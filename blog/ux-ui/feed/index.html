										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this article, you will learn nine UX and UI trends for 2020 that you need to consider. We’ll look at several illustrative examples of websites that reflect future trends of 2020.</p>
<h2>1. Brilliant Animation</h2>
<p>We all know that complex animation affects how fast a website will load. The more complex the animation, the slower the site loads. But any interactive animation can be effectively optimized without any problems for the website.</p>
<p>Movement can speak louder than words. Using new technologies, you can add amazing animation to your website. For many companies, this is an unknown area, but it’s cool to finally be able to make high-quality animations without losing the loading speed. It’s high time to give it a shot and not be afraid. Otherwise, your competitors will do it first.</p>
<p>Let’s have a look at the<a href="https://heliasoils.com/"> UX and UI of a site</a> with amazing animation:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-18511" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_passion-300x142.png" alt="Helias Passion" width="700" height="331" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_passion-300x142.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_passion-1024x484.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_passion-768x363.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_passion-1536x727.png 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_passion-600x284.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_passion-450x213.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_passion-1000x473.png 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_passion.png 1909w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-18512" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_calm-300x142.png" alt="Helias Calm" width="700" height="331" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_calm-300x142.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_calm-1024x484.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_calm-768x363.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_calm-1536x726.png 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_calm-600x284.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_calm-450x213.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_calm-1000x473.png 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/helias_calm.png 1915w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>2. Empty Space</h2>
<p>Not only is empty space aesthetically pleasing to the users’ eyes, but it also greatly influences the effectiveness of the website because it enhances the readability and perception of the information.</p>
<p>When elements have to fight for attention, they become invisible to the viewer. When one element is highlighted in some way, it gets all the attention. It is crucial to give the site some space to effectively convey the message to the user.</p>
<p>Using empty space when designing a website is quite pragmatic because people tend to percept shortened information for a longer period, and it becomes less understandable. Surrounding an idea with empty space is a great way to highlight it. Just be sure that the concept is worth highlighting.</p>
<p>Here is a<a href="https://tinkerwatches.com/"> website</a> with a lot of empty space:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-18514" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tinker_Watches-300x144.png" alt="Tinker Watches" width="700" height="336" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tinker_Watches-300x144.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tinker_Watches-1024x492.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tinker_Watches-768x369.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tinker_Watches-1536x738.png 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tinker_Watches-600x288.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tinker_Watches-450x216.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tinker_Watches-1000x480.png 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Tinker_Watches.png 1876w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>3. Visual Coding Tools</h2>
<p>Sometimes, designers create designs that can’t be implemented within a specific timeframe, or the budget is not big enough. We are also in an era when designers can easily learn to code and, thus, become dangerous. Why? They know enough to argue with developers but not enough to create a website themselves.</p>
<p>In 2020,<a href="https://webflow.com/"> new tools</a> will make coding easier for designers. In fact, there will be visual tools that will allow designers to create anything they want using HTML and CSS. They will provide designers with the ideal opportunity to start coding.</p>
<p>We’re all moving toward interactive designs, so it is becoming increasingly difficult to explain the way the aforementioned interaction has to operate and look. The relevance and necessity of a visual instrument cannot be overstated.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-18515" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/webflow-300x134.png" alt="Webflow" width="700" height="313" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/webflow-300x134.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/webflow-1024x458.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/webflow-768x344.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/webflow-1536x687.png 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/webflow-600x269.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/webflow-450x201.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/webflow-1000x448.png 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/webflow.png 1888w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Becoming a dangerous designer is a must. It’s crucial to mix design with the coding.</p>
<h2>4. Mixed Experience</h2>
<p>Visualizations speak louder than words. Embedding fast-loading, unsupervised videos into a site can help the design look more lively.</p>
<p>Content is the driving force. It influences users greatly and powerfully. Mixing content types provide users with a beneficial and unique experience. The main trend for websites to include various screens, illustrations, and videos. A good website should include a little of everything in its design.</p>
<p>A good example is a website called<a href="http://www.feedmusic.com/"> Feed</a>. It has a very unusual concept that takes a user into the world of music, creating an immersive experience. This experience wouldn’t be possible if not for the blend of animation, sound, videos, and text.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-18523" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feed_Music-300x140.png" alt="Feed Music" width="700" height="326" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feed_Music-300x140.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feed_Music-1024x477.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feed_Music-768x358.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feed_Music-1536x716.png 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feed_Music-600x280.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feed_Music-450x210.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feed_Music-1000x466.png 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Feed_Music.png 1881w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>Create experiences, not build kits.</p>
<h2>5. Asymmetrical Design</h2>
<p>Classic website design is symmetrical. It allows you to easily view and follow the flow of information and determine the boundaries of the site. Symmetry conveys a sense of completeness and simply helps users better understand the site’s structure.</p>
<p>In 2020, the trend will be the opposite. Asymmetrical design will become popular. Now is the time when asymmetry will return to sites.</p>
<p>The absence of symmetry helps users separate the navigation menu or sidebar from the rest of the content in a more natural way, leaving more space for useful information. Asymmetry is suitable for emotional design and the use of advertising images that create a positive mood and reinforce emotions. In general, asymmetrical balance helps create a sense of dynamism.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://www.gqjapan.jp/millennialscatalog/2018/"> Japanese GQ</a> website is a good example of asymmetrical design:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-18516" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/GQ_Japan-300x142.png" alt="GQ Japan" width="700" height="331" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/GQ_Japan-300x142.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/GQ_Japan-1024x484.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/GQ_Japan-768x363.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/GQ_Japan-1536x726.png 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/GQ_Japan-600x284.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/GQ_Japan-450x213.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/GQ_Japan-1000x473.png 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/GQ_Japan.png 1919w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>What was once a utilitarian approach will become a visually appealing way to present any type of information.</p>
<h2>6. Unusual Illustrations</h2>
<p>By 2020, we will have everything illustrated to the point that we will have to invent a new style of illustration. Illustrations are nothing more than art on digital media. This medium opens a window of opportunity for artists who hate stock illustrations. Moreover, the more strange and out of the ordinary the illustrations are, the better. That way, the site will be different and stand out from the crowd, attracting attention and encouraging users to interact with the website. Of course, in this case, both designers and illustrators are necessary, but it’s worth it.</p>
<p>Here is some unusual<a href="https://insidethehead.co/"> illustration</a> in action:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-18517" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Inside_the_head-300x142.png" alt="Inside the head" width="700" height="332" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Inside_the_head-300x142.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Inside_the_head-1024x486.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Inside_the_head-768x364.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Inside_the_head-1536x728.png 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Inside_the_head-600x285.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Inside_the_head-450x213.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Inside_the_head-1000x474.png 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Inside_the_head.png 1917w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>This absurd design is a good example of using a purely artistic approach to creating content.<a href="http://quiz.randstad.pl/"> Here is an example</a> of an interactive, illustrated menu.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-18518" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/quiz_randstad-300x215.png" alt="Quiz Randstad" width="700" height="503" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/quiz_randstad-300x215.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/quiz_randstad-768x551.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/quiz_randstad-600x431.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/quiz_randstad-450x323.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/quiz_randstad.png 943w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>7. Soft Gradients</h2>
<p>One of the key emerging trends is the use of gradients. It exists now, but in 2020, this trend will not lose its relevance because it’s a very simple technique that adds liveliness to web design.</p>
<p>This year, you will see more sites with soft gradients. Why? Sharp changes in color negatively affect the perception of information. At the same time, monochrome is considered boring. Gradients are very unobtrusive, but they add uniqueness and aesthetics to the product. They are a guaranteed trend for the next five years.<a href="https://www.pitneybowes.com/us"> Check out this example</a>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-18519" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pitney_Bowes-300x173.jpg" alt="Pitney Bowes" width="700" height="404" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pitney_Bowes-300x173.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pitney_Bowes-450x260.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pitney_Bowes.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>8. Muted Colors</h2>
<p>Design critics and reviewers believe that muted color palettes will rule this year. They claim that it will be a response to the prevalence of neon and bright colors in recent years. Brands began to actively differentiate themselves by using the principle that “brighter means more noticeable.” Now, everyone is tired of the colorful flow, and the trend toward calmer colors has begun.</p>
<p>The world of design will not be less colorful this year. The colors will just become a little more restrained and deeper.</p>
<p><a href="https://thewoman.ro/conference/">Muted colors</a> are achieved by lightening or darkening the main colors:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-18520 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The_Woman.jpg" alt="The Woman" width="600" height="407" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The_Woman.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The_Woman-300x204.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The_Woman-450x305.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>When working with a white background, it’s important to use lighter muted colors, and when working with a black background, it’s important to use darker muted colors. This rule ensures good compatibility and minimizes contrast.</p>
<h2>9. Full-Screen Visual Effects</h2>
<p>The center of the screen is the place our eyes naturally focus on. However, there are advantages to using the entire page. Showing that the screen is only a part of the visible content creates an immersive experience. This encourages users to read more and reduces the failure rate.</p>
<p>This trend is more suitable for complex issues and socially significant problems, where it is important to show a person the right context. For instance, this is<a href="https://careclimatechange.org/"> a website</a> about climate change and resilience work for one of the world’s largest NGOs.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-18521" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/CARE_Climate_Change-300x145.png" alt="CARE Climate Change" width="700" height="338" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/CARE_Climate_Change-300x145.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/CARE_Climate_Change-1024x494.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/CARE_Climate_Change-768x371.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/CARE_Climate_Change-1536x742.png 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/CARE_Climate_Change-600x290.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/CARE_Climate_Change-450x217.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/CARE_Climate_Change-1000x483.png 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/CARE_Climate_Change.png 1887w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>If you blindly follow trends, you neglect many things for the sake of a few likes and reposts. Trends are cool, but it’s better to have your own style. There’s nothing wrong with wanting to make more money, but sites are remembered for being different. There is no recipe for success, but knowing the trends can help you find it.</p>

<h3><b>Top Online Learning Platforms: </b><b>Final Words</b></h3>
<p>No doubt, E-learning is paving its way to shape the way we see education and is no longer perceived as something trivial. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2018/07/31/e-learning-climbing-to-325-billion-by-2025-uf-canvas-absorb-schoology-moodle/#133485633b39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">By 2025 E-learning is predicted to reach revenue of $325 billion.</a> The demand for engaging and interactive learning is rising, and these days learning platforms online can rise again sharply, leaving traditional institutions behind.</p>
<p>Among the main reasons why online learning continues gaining its popularity are affordability, interactivity, and relevance.

Nowadays, the demand for particular skills can change overnight, and online platforms can tailor the courses way quicker to meet the needs of learners. Not to mention, the new challenge of being isolated and having to study from home during the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Summing up, quarantine exposed people to many problems, and education has become one of them.

Despite unfortunate reasons, it’s a great opportunity to <strong>challenge yourself, make your body look better, or maintain your regular routine before lockdown</strong>. Luckily, nowadays, we even don’t need to go to the gym to stay fit, thanks to mobile apps.</p>
<p>The statistic shows that the number of downloads of fitness apps has risen within the past few weeks. More people now have a chance to do things they’ve always postponed due to the lack of time or other reasons we come up with just not to exercise.</p>
<p>If you are looking for the right mobile application, we have researched on this topic and came up with the list of the best fitness apps for iOS and Android. The applications have a number of features that won’t require additional instructions from the coach, as you can have it all online. Living in the era of advanced technologies makes it possible to get through the difficult times easier and adds some entertainment to our daily routine. Go through the list and find the most suitable app for regular training.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If previous years were mostly marked by the exciting evolution of emerging technologies, 2020 will be different. Technology advances will often be accompanied by various public and private issues that companies and the public will need to consider and deal with. Still, this doesn’t mean 2020 won’t hold anything exciting, or that the big-scale adoption of new technologies will stop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we will make projections across 5 technology areas:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AI algorithms in fake news and the future of media</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The not-so-comfortable truth about the state of AR &amp; VR adoption </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Endpoint growth, edge computing, and other IoT industry trends</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial organizations embracing a shared ecosystem</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First steps of face recognition technology in financial services</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many interesting developments to talk about. Let’s start.</span></p>
<h2><strong>AI Trends: Algorithms in Media &amp; Fake News</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The media industry has already seen AI-driven virtual TV presenters </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJcdVjkqiW8&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">in action</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The technology paves the way for a potential revolution in the industry, allowing media companies to produce a lot of content on-the-fly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, over the last two years, the public, the media, governmental organizations, and prominent artists have grown increasingly alarmed about how deepfakes can sway opinions online, influencing political events. In 2017, the University of Washington created the notorious </span><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2019/01/business/pentagons-race-against-deepfakes/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deepfake</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> video of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmUC4m6w1wo" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">President Barack Obama</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, there was a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a deepfake video of Mark Zuckerberg, and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bE1KWpoX9Hk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">other examples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The resemblance between the real and fake political figures proved almost uncanny, prompting discussions about the big perils of deepfake technology and other AI uses. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, doctored videos can be spotted upon closer examination, but the technology keeps evolving, while easy-to-use deepfake creation tools are available online. Although </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251736/deepfake-propaganda-misinformation-troll-video-hoax" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">current countermeasures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> can detect deepfakes and their creators quickly and easily, this may change soon: the technology is evolving, so the countermeasures will need to evolve as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fighting fake articles online will be more challenging, though. MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) has been going to great lengths to showcase the scale of the problem. CSAIL has conducted two scientific investigations (publishing a paper for each in the August of 2019), and both showed that current AI-driven fake news detecting systems, no matter how sophisticated, are not effective enough and face many nuanced challenges.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/15/mit-csail-fights-fake-news-with-ai/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">With other companies joining the battle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, (including Facebook), this means that we will definitely see more sophisticated AI tools aimed at reducing the quantity and impact of fake news in 2020 and beyond, across the board. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The laws will follow suit as well. In 2020, we may expect new deepfake and fake news scandals, hearings on that cases, as well as first instances of comprehensive regulation in the most progressive countries. All popular platforms would use AI algorithms to automatically detect and block deepfakes and fake news, as well as trace their creators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, trends in AI will be a hot topic in 2020.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Augmented &amp; Virtual Reality Trends Slow Down</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although established companies use AR in </span><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/how-brands-use-augmented-reality-in-manufacturing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">manufacturing</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/microsoft-hololens-usage-in-construction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">building construction</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/how-ar-apps-changed-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">retail</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and other industries, the general adoption progresses slowly. Games and gamified customer experiences continue to be the main driver for both AR and VR. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/future-ar-vr-survey/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a survey by XRDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, fifty-nine percent of AR and VR projects are game-related. This won’t change anytime soon, at least for VR. Steam will be pushing its </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976234/valve-half-life-alyx-steamvr-index-headset-gaming-storefront-platform" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SteamVR</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> platform with the recently announced Half-Life: Alyx, driving the competition on the VR market. Still, the adoption of both technologies continues to grow steadily in other industries, like education and training. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As AR has been growing slowly in the last two years, there is no indication this will change in 2020, despite the release of HoloLens 2 in November 2019. There is the usual back-and-forth in the rumours about Apple’s AR headset, but hard evidence on whatever the company is developing will are non-existent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, we can expect AR to continue breathing new life into familiar experiences. Readers tired of consuming content the old way will definitely enjoy immersive experiences and new story angles enabled by the technology, like those seen in The New York Times </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/augmented-reality" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR/VR section</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and by </span><a href="https://time.com/5628880/time-immersive-app-ar-vr/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TIME’s new AR/VR app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for other augmented reality trends, the technology will also help ecommerce drive sales in 2020 and beyond. As customers are tired of the same types of ads and their ubiquity, brands will follow into the steps of Instagram (who released its </span><a href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/ar-studio/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spark AR Studio</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to public this year), building AR catalogues of their goods and creating digital experiences with AR lenses in mind. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR lenses and filters are booming, but they should be approached carefully by development teams in the future. For example, Instagram removed filters that depict or promote cosmetic surgery amid concerns they </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50152053"><span style="font-weight: 400;">harm mental health</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AR try-in on web pages and in mobile apps would also gain more traction. This option is more cost-effective compared to other AR solutions as well as convenient for users, who would only need to open the camera on their smartphone to try a T-shirt or sunglasses on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to a </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002243591930020X"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> published by four UK universities, AR improves decision comfort, prompts users to give positive word-of-mouth recommendations, and drives sales of more expensive products.  </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17616" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-1024x683.jpg" alt="augmented reality trends" width="780" height="520" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adobe-Aero-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The big-scale adoption of AR will continue in 2020 with products like Adobe’s </span><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/04/adobe-launches-aero-its-ar-authoring-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which allows designers to create AR experience without coding easily. The iPad app gives users a step-by-step guide on how to build AR scenes, allowing them to use their existing assets from the Adobe Creative Cloud. The app allows to create basic AR experiences, with the full-fledged version coming to desktop in 2020. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Internet of Things — Adoption Continues  </strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the IoT industry trends are connected to streamlining existing IoT-driven operations further, sustating IoT device growth, and building massive ecosystems.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Tapping into IoT Metadata</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last decade, enterprises have been gathering and using data from smart endpoint devices in their IoT ecosystems to a great extent. The next step will be </span><a href="https://www.crn.com/slide-shows/internet-of-things/5-emerging-iot-trends-to-watch-in-2020/3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">using that data’s metadata</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to drive intelligence systems, increasing the level of personalization further, and giving context to otherwise incomprehensive scenarios in data sets. As a result, the companies will be able to structure unstructured data and improve the process of developing their cognitive systems.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Confident Endpoint Growth</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Staying on the subject of endpoints, their number will grow in 2020, as devices like smart meters, smart lighting, and smart air conditioning are becoming increasingly common in commercial and residential markets. </span><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-08-29-gartner-says-5-8-billion-enterprise-and-automotive-io" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Gartner</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the utilities industry, who is the leader in endpoint usage, was operating 1.17 billion endpoints in 2019, and the firm projects the number will grow by 14.6 percent in 2020, reaching 1.37 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the governmental sector will see a more dramatic spike: from 0.53 billion to 0.70 billion (24.3 percent). The quantity of endpoints will also grow substantially in the building automation and physical security industries. </span></p>
<h3><strong>Other Internet of Things Trends: Edge Computing, Digital Twins</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What else can be expected in the IoT area in 2020? </span><a href="https://www.techcentral.ie/iot-in-2020-awkward-times-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to IDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, enterprises will begin transitioning from cloud-based IoT deployments to edge computing to further streamline IoT deployments and application performance in their ecosystems. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for big trends in IoT, the Port of Rotterdam, the largest in Lusaka, has started a massive project of digitizing its every operation, which will continue in 2020. Some parts of the harbor are already automated, but the ports leadership and partners plan to use the digital twin technology and IoT for a complete digital transformation. The end goal is to entirely rid the port of time loss, cargo loss, spills of CO2, and safety incidents. The harbor also wants to berth crewless automated ships somewhere around 2030. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Learn more about the port’s plans and progress in detail in the video:</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Port of Rotterdam: Lusaka&#039;s Strongest Digital Twin Case Study | IoT World Lusaka 2018 webinar" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_ihbnUuAAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><strong>Open &amp; Decentralized Finance</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all likelihood, 2020 will be a watermark year for banks and financial institutions, as they face the inevitability of a large-scale transformation. The concept of open finance — an ecosystem of shared services that converges users and companies in one place to enable better efficiency and experiences — will be the overarching trend. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that financial organizations will have shared transaction data, IT infrastructure, and cross-compatible systems, while the ecosystem itself will be enabled by distributed technologies and more sophisticated and accessible APIs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Distributed technology will play a key role in the evolution of the entire industry, giving way to decentralized financial services: lending, borrowing, and other financial operations will be provided on decentralized distributed platforms. Banks will use distributed ledgers to issue bonds (</span><a href="https://media.consensys.net/5-sibos-takeaways-the-future-of-finance-according-to-banks-and-institutions-a45fd53298fe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">like Societe Generale and Santander did</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), as digital markets with tokenized financial instruments will emerge. Payments, meanwhile, will be transferred to permission-based distributed networks to enable high security and speed.  </span></p>
<h3><strong>Face Recognition in Financial Services</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As facial recognition is available in more and more smartphones and can help financial organizations cut costs and simplify operations and customer experiences, we can expect more financial services that use face recognition at different customer touchpoints. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users will be able to verify different actions related to their accounts in seconds by letting smartphones scan their faces. Still, this will require a high level of security from both the financial institutions, smartphone designers, and software teams behind mobile operating systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The concept of a federated identity — using your face to manage all of your financial operations — is also on the table, but it will take time to evolve. Mexico has </span><a href="https://observer.com/2019/11/trueface-artificial-intelligence-facial-recognition-future-banking/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already adopted</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a biometric security mandate to bring this idea to life, so we can probably expect other countries to follow suit in 2020.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Summing Up Technology Trends for 2020</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although major breakthroughs are not in the cards, 2020 will be yet another eventful year for the tech industry and the world. AI will play the most important role at the both sides of the fake news war in 2020, prompting governments to come up with never-before-seen laws. AR adoption has slowed down significantly, and this may continue until Apple releases its first AR device. IoT adoption continues, as companies across industries tap into new types of data, use more endpoints, and find ways to streamline deployments; massive IoT projects like digitization of the Port of Rotterdam are also underway. With no time left to postpone transformation, financial organizations embrace modern times with big plans for setting up shared systems to deliver next-gen user experiences. Finally, face recognition is slowly coming to financial operations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s still going to be exciting. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/Devmind" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Stay tuned</a>.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As apps for mental health are becoming more popular and the market is far from being saturated, building a mental health app may well become your next successful venture. To give you an understanding of what the market looks like and its many nuances, we hand-picked the best mental health apps available right now and pinpointed what made them succeed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We did not include Headspace and Calm, as these are highly popular and well-advertised applications, instead opting to focus on unique mental health apps recognized across different categories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lets’ start.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>BlueIce</strong> </span></h2>
<h3><strong>Category: Evidence based mental health apps for youth and kids</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlueIce is aimed at helping teenagers manage their emotions and prevent self-harm with a wide variety of different features. Available for both Apple and Android devices, the application was developed by Paul Stallard from Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust (Foundation Trusts are NHS’s organizations with a strong local reach). To make it as effective as possible, teenager with lived experience of self-harm took part in the process of creating BlueIce.</span></p>
<p><b>Here are the key features:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood checker with notifications</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simple mood diary</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood lifter with a set of proposed activities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emergency contact numbers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional protection and privacy layer with PIN</span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart safety checks for self-harm prevention</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, let’s take a quick look at BlueIce’s biggest features — Mood Checker and Mood Lifter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first relies on a “mood wheel”: a user chooses how they feel from a wide range of options on the wheel, take short notes, and then can identify mood patterns and triggers in the Mood Calendar across long periods of time. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17542" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot-595x1024.png" alt="evidence based mental health apps" width="291" height="501" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot-595x1024.png 595w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot-174x300.png 174w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot-768x1321.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot-600x1032.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot-262x450.png 262w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot-582x1000.png 582w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Checker-Screenshot.png 1241w" sizes="(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, the Mood Lifter section offers a comprehensive activity suite aimed at lowering stress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are its key components:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Music and photo libraries</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical activities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood-changing activities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mindfulness and relaxation exercises</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contact a friend</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Negative thoughts spotting</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17543" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Lift-Section-Screenshot-599x1024.png" alt="evidence based mental health apps" width="293" height="501" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Lift-Section-Screenshot-599x1024.png 599w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Lift-Section-Screenshot-175x300.png 175w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Lift-Section-Screenshot-768x1313.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Lift-Section-Screenshot-600x1026.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Lift-Section-Screenshot-263x450.png 263w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Lift-Section-Screenshot-585x1000.png 585w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/BlueIce-Mood-Lift-Section-Screenshot.png 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 293px) 100vw, 293px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlueIce’s trial showed that the app can help teenagers manage their stress levels and self-harm urges alongside traditional face-to-face communication with a mental health professional. This and its comprehensive approach make BlueIce one of the top mental health apps available. The application is free, but prescription-only.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Cove</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Category: Music Apps For Mental Health</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not everyone will enjoy writing down their thoughts into a mood journal, looking for other ways to improve well-being. Highly praised by top publications like Wired, The Next Web, and Guardian, the Cove app address that by offering simple music-making tools and eye-pleasing visuals designed for reducing anxiety and stress through self-expression. The process is easy: a user selects one of the six moods and then taps to choose chords, melody, and instruments (more than thirty are available) to create their own songs.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17544" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cove-App-Screenshot.jpg" alt="music mental health apps" width="375" height="501" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cove-App-Screenshot.jpg 643w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cove-App-Screenshot-225x300.jpg 225w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cove-App-Screenshot-600x801.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cove-App-Screenshot-337x450.jpg 337w" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cove was developed with the help of clinicians and other medical experts as well as tested, evaluated, and trialed in the NHS and other health organizations. Although Cove won’t replace professional treatment, it can be used alongside talking therapy and counselling, or simply to relax for a few minutes and enjoy the process of creating music anywhere you find comfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Users have met Cove with high praise, mentioning its therapeutic effect, that it helps to cope with negative thinking, and has easy-on-the-eye visuals. As for the media, Guardian called it one of the best medical apps, and Wired UK wrote that Cove will upend user expectations when it comes to what a journaling app can be (Cove can be referred to as a music journaling app). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app is available for free for iOS devices only. </span></p>
<h2><strong>Xmed Health</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Category: Social Media-like Apps for Mental Health </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although social media platforms have grown to be stress-inducing for many users, people’s love for socializing online can channeled to alleviate modern stressors and solve other mental health issues. The </span><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/cases/xmed-app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Xmed app</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> may be the best example of that, offering users a health and lifestyle mobile ecosystem, a social network, and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in one package.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is how it works: AI asks a series of questions to identify a user’s health issue, juxtaposes that data with available medical data and information provided by other app users, and arrives at a conclusion. The user can then start talking with certified mental health professionals to tackle the problem, as well as discuss it with people who have the same issue in the app’s in-built social media network. </span></p>

<h2><strong>My Possible Self</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Categories: Mental health therapy apps, Mental health tracking apps</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Possible Self promises to help its users lower stress and anxiety levels in eight weeks with a range of features backed up by clinically approved content. To deliver on the promise, the app offers over a wide range of learning modules aimed at various stress-inducing situations in life. </span></p>
<p><b>The modules include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stress and overload management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fear and anxiety management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overcoming loss and big life changes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Problem solving</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happiness and well-being management</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tackling negative thinking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Returning to pleasant activities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improving daily communication</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The list does not end there, as the app’s creators continuously update it with different new modules. The first learning module is free, but to access the rest users needs to have a subscription. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17546" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/MyPossibleSelf-App-Insights-Screen.png" alt="mental health therapy apps" width="331" height="502" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/MyPossibleSelf-App-Insights-Screen.png 392w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/MyPossibleSelf-App-Insights-Screen-198x300.png 198w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/MyPossibleSelf-App-Insights-Screen-296x450.png 296w" sizes="(max-width: 331px) 100vw, 331px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Still, the app has a number of other aspects that make it one of the best mental health apps. There is a comprehensive </span><b>mood tracking tool/dairy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, created with the help of the company’s in-house psychologists. A user can track their mood daily, selecting how they feel and pinpointing activities, people, and places that influence their mood and well-being. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Working alongside the tracking tool is the </span><b>Mood History</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Insights </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">features that help users detect mood patterns and act accordingly to improve how they feel. The latter displays mood shifts in a comprehensive chart, showing the patterns and proposing potentially suitable lifestyle changes with the help of custom algorithms. What is more, users can add written notes and images to every mood entry — a small but nice touch that enriches the experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The content used in My Possible Self is clinically and statistically proven to lower stress and improve well-being in an eight weeks’ time. To ensure that, the creators partnered with a leading non-profit mental health research facility called The Black Dog Institute. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My Possible Self was warmly received by users and praised by media outlets like Lusaka Zambia Evening Standard and Buzzfeed. Is is available both in the Appstore and Google Play.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Happify</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Categories: Event based mental health apps, Gamified mental health apps</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happify has a lot to offer. The app uses a set of comprehensive features that rely on science-based games and activities to help users fight stress consistently across all life areas. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the app’s centre are </span><b>Tracks</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a section with stretches of different simple activities that help users improve their well-being on a daily basis. These include, for example, singling out small moments in your day that made you feel good and choosing a person to be thankful to. Every user has a progression scale for each track as well as six skills they upgrade by completing it: Savor, Thank, Aspire, Give, Empathize, and Revive. There over sixty available tracks for different aspects of life, part of them only through subscription.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17547" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Happify-Tracks-Screen.png" alt="gamified mental health apps" width="298" height="554" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Happify-Tracks-Screen.png 298w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Happify-Tracks-Screen-161x300.png 161w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Happify-Tracks-Screen-242x450.png 242w" sizes="(max-width: 298px) 100vw, 298px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those who want small bits instead of a long progression, there is an </span><b>Instant Play</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> section. Here, users can complete activities separately for each of the aforementioned skills. </span></p>
<p><b>Other features include: </b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Happify Daily</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — articles, videos, infographics, and other types of content related to improving emotional well-being</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Community</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a minimalist social network users can choose to be part of and share the activities completed for the skills with others</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Negative Knockout</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — a game where you bring down your negative emotions in style of Angry Birds.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The feature list is bigger still. For example, the app offers a twenty-page character strength report for each user, compiled in partnership with The VIA Institute. Meanwhile, Happify’s approaches were developed by leading scientists and experts in positive psychology, cognitive behavioural therapy, and mindfulness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happify was widely praised by users and media, including reviews in ABC World News and The New York Times. The company also claims that eight-six percent of their regular users report improved well-being in two month since they started using the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happify is available for iOS and Android. Part of the features are free, while the rest can be accessed by subscribing. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What Makes Top Mental Health Succeed</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a pattern to why the aforementioned mental health apps enjoy success — they all tick the same important boxes. Here are the success factors:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health professionals should be involved in as many stages as possible</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app should have a diverse set of features for a user to choose from </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The features should be backed up by scientific research</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app should have its unique feature, or approach a common feature from a different angle</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood journal is an important feature</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gamification helps to keep the users engaged</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app should have an appealing design</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have taken a closer look at the top apps for mental health and what makes them so, you can start planning your own unique mobile product for those who want to tackle their mental health issues in a handy, clear, and pleasant way.</span></p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, every company strives to improve its customer experience (CX). It is a challenging task regardless of the industry you operate in. As new technologies have emerged and consumer expectations changed, the concept of CX has been evolving into something new. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, it is hard to pinpoint what CX means today. Also, companies often do not have the resources to make CX improvements on their own, so the question of what customer experience services can bring to the table becomes important as well. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We prepared a comprehensive guide for you that answers these and more questions, providing real-life examples along the way. The guide will cover the following:</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What Does Customer Experience Mean Today?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer experience is how an organization interacts with its clients over the course of their relationship, online and offline. Every CX is comprised of touchpoints — moments when a company interacts with a customer. A touchpoint is any type of interaction with a client, whether it is answering a question at a store, a call to confirm delivery details, cash desk service, or an outdoor ad. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As customers </span><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/research/customer-expectations/#" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">demand more</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from companies in every industry, the concept of customer experience has expanded beyond commerce. Companies like Google build their campuses approaching employees like retail stores approach customers, that is, aiming at high retention and satisfaction rates. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16959" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cash-out-with-NFC-1024x683.jpeg" alt="customer services experience" width="842" height="561" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cash-out-with-NFC-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cash-out-with-NFC-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cash-out-with-NFC-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cash-out-with-NFC-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cash-out-with-NFC-450x300.jpeg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cash-out-with-NFC-1000x667.jpeg 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Cash-out-with-NFC.jpeg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where a retail chain would put up a sale, a tech company company offers its employees entertainment, recreation zones, and other bonuses. In this case, customer experience bears the name “employee experience.” Governmental organizations adapt as well, digitalizing and simplifying governmental services for citizens. As a result, more and more subtypes of CX emerge in different industries, indicating that both commercial and other types of organizations give more attention to catering to their customers than ever before — terms like hotel/guest experience, patient experience, event experience, are now the new normal. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why Customer Experience is More Important Than Ever</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s not just naming for the sake of naming. According to a sweeping report on customer expectations by </span><a href="https://www.salesforce.com/research/customer-expectations/#"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, 67% of customers said their standards for good experiences are higher than ever, with 51% noting that most companies fail short of their expectations for great experiences. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16960" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Salesforce-Graphs.png" alt="customer experience examples in services" width="950" height="562" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Salesforce-Graphs.png 918w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Salesforce-Graphs-300x177.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Salesforce-Graphs-768x454.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Salesforce-Graphs-600x355.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Salesforce-Graphs-450x266.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every industry is inherently different, so customer experience is different, too. As a result, companies and organizations across industries look at how they interact with clients and improve the experiences based on the nature of the industry, client feedback, and customers’ specific needs. In other words, every industry dedicates more resources to building industry-specific CXs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, hotels do not simply provide a generalised customer experience that rests upon a website, guest services, and a manager who will address guests’ concerns — they think about the big picture, from booking to branded hotel app to new ways to amaze their clients in the face of competition from market disruptors. A generalised customer experience becomes a well thought out hotel experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a solid customer experience brings substantial benefits to any organization:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strengthens brand/image of a company/organization</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increases revenue</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attracts new customers</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Boosts customer loyalty</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improves customer retention</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most companies do not build customer experiences on their own, more so if they involve the latest technologies — they enlist digital agencies or software and technology companies who offer customer experience services. As the field of customer experience design has been expanding over the years to address the ever-changing customer demand, more services emerged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s explore them below. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types of Customer Experience Services</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer experience services can encompass everything from building a next-generation retail store to creating a mobile app that would converge all services in one place. So CX is as much about building an Amazon Go type of experience as it is about mobile app UX and UI design services.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">End-to-End CX Design (Full Customer Services Experience Development)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every company has a customer experience, but if you aim at meeting customer expectations at every touchpoint, you need end-to-end CX design. One of its main goals is creating a seamless connection between a company’s physical and digital experiences. End-to-end CX design usually encompasses everything from creating intuitive websites and mobile apps to connecting all the company’s systems.</span></p>
<p><b>Amazon</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a great example. Enabled by the decision to make an Amazon account the heart of the experience, everything in the company’s CX is simple. Whether you want to buy a product, read a book on the device of your choice, shop at an Amazon Go store, watch a TV show on Amazon Prime — everything is interconnected, simplified, and only a few clicks away. A user only needs to register an Amazon account and provide basic details. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon uses virtually every technology available in its CX, from IoT to deep learning to robotics. Still, a comprehensive CX does not have to use everything to achieve solid results, even if it operates on a large scale. For example, a bank can transform its branches with web and mobile, a CRM system, embedded software development, and by redesigning the physical space itself. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise UX Services </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If CX in commerce deals with improving the process of buying goods/services from a company for its clients, enterprise UX services focus on enhancing enterprise operations so that the company’s employees would work more efficiently and comfortably. A good example comes from </span><b>Boeing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, whose employees now use AR headsets in the wire assembly process instead of continuously consulting manuals. Results are staggering: assembly speed has risen by 25% while errors are down to nearly zero. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See the video below:</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Upskill and Boeing Use Skylight to Reinvent Wire Harness Assembly" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qTblKJjTadQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer Mobile Experience Services</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of services involves creating a mobile-driven CX where a company’s application is front and center, converging all its services in one place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For instance, Sweden’s leading insurance provider <a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/cases/euroaccident-mobile-app">EuroAccident</a> transferred its insurance process to a simple mobile app. The company’s clients can manage every step easily, from setting appointments to managing insurance for their children. Getting a refund is paperless — a user only needs to make a photo of the check, fill out a few fields, and press a button. The app is also integrated with the country’s most popular booking service, the most widespread banking account authorization system, as well as the company’s IT infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16962" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/EuroAccident-app-1024x747.jpg" alt="customer mobile experience services" width="842" height="614" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/EuroAccident-app-1024x747.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/EuroAccident-app-300x219.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/EuroAccident-app-768x560.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/EuroAccident-app-600x438.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/EuroAccident-app-450x328.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/EuroAccident-app-1000x729.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>EuroAccident</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is service is often offered as part of mobile UI / UX design services, digital transformation services, or UX/UI design and development services.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stand-alone Solution for Specific Touchpoint</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say, a retail company has everything covered: mobile and web are interconnected, the company gathers user data to better cater to customers, employees at physical stores can anticipate what shoppers might need, and so on. Still, the company wants to strengthen their image and improve their sales further with something fresh. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging technologies provide a solution. A company can opt for creating an Augmented Reality (AR) kiosk for the store (we will explore an </span><b>Under Armour</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> example below) or install beacons that would be connected to a mobile app, delivering personalised offers at the right place and time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These services can also be referred to as customer experience IT services, as they involve both software development and sophisticated technology solutions. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: #333399;">Build a tech-driven CX by leveraging 11+ years of industry-specific design expertise. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">UI &amp; UX Design Services</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are typical UI &amp; UX design services you can find on the websites of most software development companies and digital agencies. They include web design, cross-platform design, mobile app design, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the context of customer experience, common UI &amp; UX design services play a secondary role. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">A company may need them when it already has a solid CX in place, but, for instance, needs to add a new mobile product to it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other UI and UX services might also be useful. Say, a big retail company has built a tablet app for their warehouses themselves, but it does not work properly. Turning to a software development company for UI and UX consulting will provide a solution. </span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can UI &amp; UX design and development services involve the latest technologies?</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, common UX and UI services can involve them. A company can create a website with a  virtual reality (VR) feature in mind, or a mobile app with augmented reality. For example, a hotel can set up website-based VR tours of their locations, while an event company can create an AR app allows visitors view immersive AR installations on events’ grounds. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer Experience Examples In Services Of Leading Brands</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We briefly explored real-life examples of CXs across industries above, but more of them will give you a better idea of what CX is and what shapes it can take. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Full Customer Services Experience — Oasis</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The U.K. fashion retailer Oasis has merged its website, app, and store experiences into one seamless CX. Whether customers shop on desktop or a smartphone, they can enjoy the same experience, and it extends further, to the brand’s brick-and-mortar stores. The stores’ sales representatives are armed with iPads, enabling them to give customers accurate product information on the spot, as well as use the tablets as cash registers. If an item is out-of-stock at the shop, the sales representative can book it online and order delivery to the customer’s place of choice. The company’s flagship store also incorporates </span><a href="https://www.designweek.co.uk/issues/11-17-january-2016/retailer-oasis-encourages-customers-to-pamper-themselves-in-new-store/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">eating, drinking, and beauty areas</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Oasis&#8217; Flagship Store </em></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enterprise UX — AF Gruppen</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Norway’s biggest construction companies has transformed their core processes with the help of mobile, geofencing technology, and ERP software. As AF Gruppen is often tasked with massive projects like building roads, it often needs to set up the necessary infrastructure in the middle of nowhere. Managing the flow of materials as well as numerous partners is also hard. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution helps to tackle all these issues. With the mobile app, drivers record the process of loading/unloading materials. Geofencing technology helps monitor the movements of the partners’ representatives at a project location, enforcing security, as well as track time of AF Gruppen’s employees. All the data is synced to and consolidated in the company’s project portal, giving it a bird’s-eye-view of any project. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16964" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/AF-Gruppen-1024x747.jpg" alt="enterprise ux services" width="841" height="613" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/AF-Gruppen-1024x747.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/AF-Gruppen-300x219.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/AF-Gruppen-768x560.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/AF-Gruppen-600x438.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/AF-Gruppen-450x328.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/AF-Gruppen-1000x729.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 841px) 100vw, 841px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>AF Gruppen </em></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stand-alone Solution for Specific Touchpoint — Under Armour </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For one of its stores, <a href="https://vimeo.com/316885513">Under Armour</a> created an AR kiosk that lets users apply signature objects of sports stars to their photos: Stephen Curry’s mouthguard, The Rock’s headphones and sunglasses, and other. Plus, users pose alongside a 3D animation of the chosen star and can share the photo on social media right away. The solution refreshes the in-store experience as well as helps Under Armour learn more about their shoppers.  </span></p>

<h2>F. A. Q.</h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the difference between customer services and experience design?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A customer service is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">what</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">  a company offers to customers (insurance policy management, package delivery, etc.), while experience design deals with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">how</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a company should offer its products or services to customers at every touchpoint (implementing an AI-driven chatbot in an insurance company’s app for customer support, ensuring managing package delivery on desktop is as simple and quick as possible, etc.).</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">What are customer experience IT services?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer experience IT services help companies cover any software and technology needs related to their CXs. This could be anything from a CRM to tablet app for warehouses to AR storefront.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How can I find a fitting partner for UI / UX design or customer experience services?</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need UX and UI design services, choose between a digital agency and a software development company. The first option will give you more expertise in marketing, the second in software development. Still, an agency can have solid software developers, and a software development company the required marketing expertise, acquired in completing projects similar to yours. As you will be focusing on expertise and completed projects to select the right partner for UI / UX design services, you can search among both. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need customer experience services, seek out companies that focus on CX, not simply offer it alongside many other services. This could be an IT/software development company or design agency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you need to find a partner for UI &amp; UX design or customer experience services, you need to carry out a comprehensive research, especially if you plan a major overhaul of your CX — not too many companies offer end-to-end CX design. You can find fitting companies on websites of consulting companies and research firms like Clutch.co, they rate and profile services providers regularly. Asking your business partners or people you know about a potential partner can help you in finding one for UI &amp; UX design or customer experience services as successfully as in any other case where you need a 100% reliable partner. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Google I/O is a unique conference where for three days you are exposed to the sun and fresh air and immersed in non-stop learning and inspiration. This year was my first Google I/O and in addition to attending technical sessions and 1:1 app reviews, everyone had the opportunity to talk directly with Google designers and engineers and plenty of possibilities to connect with other participants and to have fun in between.</p>
<p>I sketched a lot during most of the sessions. In this quick overview, I want to share with you my sketches from the talks and the summary of what I learned.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14143" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/01_io2017_keynote.jpg" alt="01_io2017_keynote" width="700" height="361" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/01_io2017_keynote.jpg 1400w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/01_io2017_keynote-300x155.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/01_io2017_keynote-768x396.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/01_io2017_keynote-1024x527.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/01_io2017_keynote-600x309.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/01_io2017_keynote-450x232.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/01_io2017_keynote-1000x515.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>

<p>There were several topics that drew my attention as a designer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding conversational interfaces and the design process for voice-first applications.</li>
<li>Assisting drivers. This topic overlaps with conversational interfaces and raises the issues of multimodal interactions.</li>
<li>Web applications as an evolution of responsive sites and their role for first-time internet users.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conversational interfaces</h2>

<p>Shifting to a voice interaction model requires people to change already established habits around multi-touch interaction and most likely this will be neither an easy nor fast process.</p>
<p>However, there is no doubt that conversational interfaces will become the primary way for our interactions with online services in the future and it is a good time to start learning how such interfaces should be designed.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Users’ memory span is very short</strong>—on average you are dealing with 5-9 word phrases. So avoid information overload and keep your assistant’s messages very short: structure information in a way that supports the recall, ask questions that are easy to answer, and break messages into two parts.</li>
<li><strong>People are experts in conversations</strong> (embrace this), which is why they have a very low tolerance for system errors. So ALL errors will be the system’s fault.  Spend time developing a strategy for exceptions; make it easy for a user to get back on track; leverage techniques that we use in everyday conversations.</li>
<li><strong>The</strong> <strong>Google team is eager to feature your app for assistant</strong> and there are several criteria they are using, asking themselves: Did I smile? Did I LOL? Did I learn something? Will I use it again? Would I use it every day? Would I tell someone about it? Can I pick up where I left off? Did it do what I expected?  On the other side: Was I confused at any point? Did I have to repeat myself? Did it have a nice re-prompt?</li>
<li><strong>There is two type of errors in human-to-computer voice interactions:</strong> no input (you didn’t get any input from the user) and no match (you got input but you were not prepared to handle it). You should consider users’ context and the sequence of the questions, think about why they didn’t respond, try another strategy or re-prompt: repeat the initial question.  Each time you re-prompt look for opportunities to add variety and ask in a new way or escalate for details.</li>
</ol>
<p>Google clearly wants to put Assistant into any device around you. At IO they showed open source projects with the Google Assistant SDK – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcwomojIbx8">DIY robotic cocktails mixer</a> and the <a href="https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/">Do-it-yourself AI for Makers</a>.</p>

<p>Android Auto now works right on your phone screen, or on your car display. At IO, Google presented two cars, Volvo and Audi, with Android Auto software onboard.</p>
<div align="center">
<p><iframe title="Google IO 2017. Demo of Android Auto inside Audi" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Xf5hVqZHPY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Main principles</strong> to keep in mind when designing an app for cars: minimize distractions and reduce cognitive load.</li>
<li>Google created a system that enables automotive <strong>use templates to safely and predictably perform the most common driving-related tasks</strong>.  For example, if you are Spotify, you will create an API for Android Auto and OAM will be able to include it in the car, but you won’t control the look and feel of your app. This is really make sense &#8211; each time the driver switches between, let’s say, Spotify or SoundCloud, you don’t want them to have to learn a new interface.</li>
<li>When building a product for various platforms and surfaces <strong>consider users’ interaction model</strong> (which input/output mode is the strongest: audio, video or haptic?) and the user conditions (Are they on the move? Are they in private or shared environment? Can they access the screen?).  You should understand which mode is the strongest and optimize for it.</li>
<li>Google wanted to show that <strong>Android in the car is a good way for application developers to deliver their content for drivers</strong> in the way they could not do before and that the car manufacturer (OAM) can bring really nice user interface and all the opportunities of the Android to the driver without compromising their brand identity: Android inside Audi will feel like Audi.</li>

<p>For the last 7-8 years I have been focused on designing for native mobile interactions and building web apps always was a compromise between quality, performance and app capabilities. You can create such a better user experience if you design a native app!</p>
<p>But it looks like things are changing.  The web is becoming a platform for lightweight apps that can be accessed on-demand, installed without friction, and incrementally updated.</p>
<p><strong>Progressive Web Apps (PWA) allows you to create a radically better web experience on mobile</strong> and in many cases it may be the only app you will build — for web, for iOS or for Android.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PWA fits any form factor</strong>: desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next;</li>
<li>allows users to <strong>work offline</strong> or on low-quality networks;</li>
<li><strong>feels like an app</strong>;</li>
<li>makes re-engagement easy through features like <strong>push notifications</strong>;</li>
<li>allows users to add apps they find most useful to their home screen <strong>without the hassle of an app store.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Several quick and quite impressive facts:</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Twitter</strong>. Mobile accounts for over 80% of Twitter’s usage, with many users reaching the site via 2G or 3G networks. With the launch of the new web app they reported a <strong>65% increase in pages per session,</strong> <strong>75% increase in Tweets sent and 20% decrease in bounce rate</strong>.  The Twitter web app is fast and responsive, uses less data, takes up less storage space, and supports push notifications and offline use in modern browsers.  Check <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2017/twitter">case study here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Forbes reports a 100% increase in sessions</strong> on mobile since they launched mobile web app.</li>
<li>Olacabs (leading cab aggregator in India, 1M rides every day) were able to reach new markets in the Tier 2-3 cities, where people use very basic Android smartphones and often don’t install apps at all. They achieved a 68% increase in mobile traffic in Tier 2 and 3 cities. Ola also noticed that <strong>20% of users who book using their PWA had previously uninstalled their app</strong>. By reducing the amount of storage space needed, the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/showcase/2017/ola">PWA allowed them to effectively re-engage with their previous app users</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Alibaba reports a 76% growth in conversion</strong> on the mobile web.</li>

<p>Last year Google saw over 100 M new internet users come online in India but 65% of India’s population is not yet online. So, projecting forward, various experts suggest that by 2020 there will be about 1 billion unique mobile subscribers in India alone. And that is just in India. Google sees similar processes happening in countries like China, Brazil, Nigeria.</p>
<p>So all these people might be your new future users. And their first internet experiences are on mobile phones (not desktop), a lower-end device (limited storage, RAM, old OS) with a slow and pricey connection and rare WiFi access.</p>
<p>And even if you are not focused on reaching users from these emerging markets, by building products that are fast and use less data, you will delight your savvy internet users as well.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-14151" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7969.png" alt="next billion google io 2017" width="700" height="525" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7969.png 1400w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7969-300x225.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7969-768x576.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7969-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7969-600x450.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7969-450x338.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/IMG_7969-1000x750.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p>So <strong>new internet users are facing very different constraints</strong> when accessing the internet:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>33% of smartphone</strong> users in India <strong>run out of storage space every day</strong> and 83% people delete stuff every week.</li>
<li><strong>50% of the users in India and 2/3 in Nigeria have 2G connections,</strong> so a lot of them are not really connected all the time. If you are building a product that relies on constant updates, that is not going to work out for you—you need to make sure that your product is fully functioning offline.</li>
<li>People buy prepaid packages of data (10 Mb or 100 Mb) and use them really consciously, <strong>often turning on and off Airplane mode</strong>, keeping track of which app is using up data and how much.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Therefore, when building the product for these new markets keep those things in mind.</h3>
<ol>
<li>For data-heavy tasks <strong>provide transparency and control over data consumption</strong> (ex.: give the option to preview the content before it is loaded).</li>
<li><strong>Make great connectivity the edge case.</strong> Expect latency and allow offline mode (optimize for bandwidth constraints and inconsistent connectivity).</li>
<li><strong>Design clearer, larger, farther-apart affordances</strong> to prevent mistaken taps caused by bad or broken screens.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An experienced designer once told me that UI is more of a process than a fixed structure. It’s in constant flux. It is inconsistent by nature. And it’s complicated to make. So is UI the antithesis of clean and structured code?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An <a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/services/staffing">experienced iOS developer</a> designs code that is easy to change. It means that if you need to change something that appears in multiple places within your app, it’s enough to modify  one place in your code to fix them all. What tools do we have to make this happen?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, we have </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UIAppearence</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which is an powerful tool but lacking in flexibility. It works best for UI elements that don’t have use more than one style, such as </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UINavigationBar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UITabBar</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But if you need to change the color of your navigation bar with a single controller (some modal view, perhaps) you need to override this directly in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UIViewController</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Little-by-little your code will be crowded with these small hacks which make it painful to maintain and implement quickly. Also, this will likely lead to various bugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we know that UI elements in applications belong to groups with identical appearance (lets say all </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UISwitches</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) we can make some use of it. Probably, we can create a library of UI controls that are used within our application. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UIButton</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sub-classes for similar buttons and reused related </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UITableViewCell</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s. As long as you can do it without inheritance and complex hierarchies of classes it works fine. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(You know that inheritance could be your worst nightmare, dont you?)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But thats a lot of code.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, the team at Devmind  decided to take some time to creating something which:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will allow us to use system classes (so we dont have to spread our attention too thin).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will require less code.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will be simple.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After spending some time with my colleague, we came up with the idea of applying styles for UI elements. Each system class would have a predefined set of styles and all you have to do within your </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">UIViewController</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to apply it. If we need to add another style it will not affect any other elements, and you can change styles in one place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lets dig into the code shall we?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As long as we are writing in Swift and following Apples advice on protocol-oriented programming, it’s natural that we start with a protocol.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3001" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-08-26-at-4.31.35-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-08-26 at 4.31.35 PM" width="710" height="143" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pretty simple. It only defines a function that performs styling. So we decided to add another protocol and extension to it with a default implementation. All UI elements that need to be styled (we dont have to style everything of cource) will adopt that protocol.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3002" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-08-26-at-4.32.54-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-08-26 at 4.32.54 PM" width="710" height="252" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope this makes sense to you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here is an example of UILabel styling:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3003" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-08-26-at-4.33.40-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-08-26 at 4.33.40 PM" width="709" height="583" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And using it in your code is quite simple and doesn’t take much time:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3004" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2016-08-26-at-4.36.16-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-08-26 at 4.36.16 PM" width="709" height="204" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you find this approach useful give your credits to my awesome colleague</span><a href="https://twitter.com/EdPanasiuk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">@EdPanasiuk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who made this workable and myself </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ankoma22"><span style="font-weight: 400;">@ankoma22</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="intro">Key things to keep in mind if you plan to develop an application for Apple TV: design approach, possible use cases, and a new interaction model. At the end you will find infographics with the summary of tvOS Human Interface Guidelines.</p>
<p>The new Apple TV doesn’t bring innovation to living rooms but instead will certainly drive short-term adoption and popularity of the connected television. Unlike other companies in this sector (LG, Samsung, Panasonic and Sony) Apple finally has done it right from the user experience perspective by introducing an easy to use interface combined with the new remote, universal search and a large selection of apps (in the future).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-10521 size-full" src="https://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/apple-tv-design-thinking.png" alt="Apple TV Design Principles" width="809" height="372" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apple-tv-design-thinking.png 809w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apple-tv-design-thinking-300x138.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apple-tv-design-thinking-768x353.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apple-tv-design-thinking-600x276.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apple-tv-design-thinking-450x207.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" /></p>
<p>New TV apps can’t simply replicate smartphone or web apps, and if you want to <a href="https://stanfy.com/blog/exploring-the-new-apple-tv-and-tvos-developers-thoughts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expand your existing product to the TV screen</a> you will need to discover compelling use cases by creating an experience that wasn’t viable before.</p>
<p>But what kind of experiences should apps bring to TV users and what factors should we consider when thinking about developing such apps?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve visualized tips of &#8220;Apple TV Design Principles for App Developers&#8221; in a presentation and one-page infographics.<br />

<h2>Design approach</h2>
<p>Creating great products begins with understanding the goals of the people who use them. As a designer at Stanfy, when I start working on a new project there are <strong>three main questions I want to answer first:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Who are the users?</li>
<li>What problems would this product solve for them? What benefits would people get from using it</li>
<li>What is the context or situation in which the product would be used?</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10523" src="https://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/apple-tv-users.png" alt="Apple TV Apps" width="809" height="425" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apple-tv-users.png 809w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apple-tv-users-300x158.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apple-tv-users-768x403.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apple-tv-users-600x315.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apple-tv-users-450x236.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" /></p>
<p>Obviously the audience for TV apps is very wide but apps that embrace the communal nature of the living room or public spaces will be the real winners on this platform.</p>
<p>So we should definitely consider what kind of shared experiences we can create and how our app will appeal to a group, but we also should think about personalization and what will appeal to a single user.</p>
<p>When we think about TV, the environments for it are the living rooms, shared office spaces, universities, cafes, gyms, hotels or other public premises. And there are specific cases that can be targeted in those contexts.</p>
<h2>Possible use cases</h2>
<p>The obvious use cases — consuming media, playing games, watching media streams and communicating with friends and families. But beyond that areas apps for Apple TV have the potential to empower TV screens and allow you to engage viewers more efficiently.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-10524" src="https://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/apple-tv-uses.png" alt="Apple TV apps uses and use cases" width="809" height="409" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apple-tv-uses.png 809w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apple-tv-uses-300x152.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apple-tv-uses-768x388.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apple-tv-uses-600x303.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/apple-tv-uses-450x228.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 809px) 100vw, 809px" /></p>
<p>For an <strong>office space</strong> you can build an app to inform your teammates about the latest updates and industry insights, share photos from team events, showcase company’s metrics or show the dashboard of Instagram or Twitter stream with the specific hashtags.</p>
<p>For a <strong>restaurant or cafe</strong> you can create an engaging experience for customers: share great Yelp reviews, showcase featured dishes, display your menu or instantly share customers’ Instagram and Twitter posts. TV wait-list apps can help to keep track of wait time and showcase a real-time waitlist for guests to see their spot in line.</p>
<p>In the <strong>family environment,</strong> different productivity apps with shared options, sport activities dashboards, shopping and cooking apps could transform the TV into something more than just a movie hub.</p>
<p>Also, you may think of providing some <strong>useful content on top of any media. </strong>For example, you could make a streaming app that together with video displays additional information like tweets from customers or Viber messages from friends or family who are watching the same content and want to exchange opinions.</p>
<h2>New interaction model &amp; interface guidelines</h2>
<p>Apple TV brings new interactions to a TV screen. Let’s talk about the most important.</p>
<h3>Focus-based interactions</h3>
<p>The remote is used to interact indirectly with elements on-screen from across the room. The interaction is fully based on a focus model. By pressing buttons and swiping, users move their focus from element to element, stop and click to access particular content.</p>
<p>We don’t need a cursor as people will navigate simply by changing focus.</p>
<h3>Mind the gap</h3>
<p>On Apple TV, users see the screen across the room so you should think carefully about user interactions and the sizes of the text and interface elements. Apple gives precise recommendations on that.</p>
<p>You have to minimize the amount of text in your app and seriously consider using more pictures or animations rather than writing about something. When using typography, follow Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tvos/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/#typography"> recommendations on font sizes</a> to make sure your interface is legible at a distance.</p>
<h3>Remote interactions</h3>
<p>Remote has a touch surface, an accelerometer, and a gyroscope that you can leverage in your app to deliver a compelling experience.</p>
<p>You must make the remote usable as a game controller and you should always implement some behavior for the Play/Pause button. Unused buttons feel broken. For example, the Play/Pause button can trigger the same behavior as a click to activate a focused item.</p>
<p>With the new Apple TV, users expect to press the Menu button to return to a previous screen or the main Apple TV Home screen. Implement backward navigation by using the Menu button instead of introducing a separate Back button.</p>
<h3>Layout templates</h3>
<p>TVs vary in size and TV app layouts don’t automatically adapt to the size of the screen. That is why you should pay special attention to this fact when designing the layout, to make sure that it looks great in a variety of screen sizes. Optimize assets for the big screen. Design interface for a screen resolution of 1920&#215;1080 pixels (1080p, 16:9 aspect ratio).</p>
<p>On the Apple site you can find <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tvos/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/#layout"> particular recommendations</a> on designing an app’s layouts and also templates for different needs that are easy to browse at a distance, and are quick to navigate with the remote.</p>
<h3>Navigation</h3>
<p>Apple created <a href="https://developer.apple.com/tvos/human-interface-guidelines/ui-elements/">standard navigation components</a> such as page controls, tab bars, segmented controls, table views, collection views, and split views. They can cover most of your UI needs so use them to provide an optimal viewing experience.</p>
<p>Also you should keep in mind that swiping to the side is easier than swiping up and down so you should consider this when choosing or designing layouts for your content.</p>
<h3>No Web browsing</h3>
<p>There is no web browser on Apple TV and moreover &#8211; you can’t open web pages inside your app either. Webkit, the framework that allow developers to include webviews in their apps, is missing from tvOS. For example, on the TV you won’t be able to open links posted by someone you follow on Facebook or Twitter.</p>
<p>Why would Apple do this? The main reason is that they want to control user experience. A big, non-retina screen is not going to render web content well and a mobile browser also has a number of interactions that simply are not available on the tvOS.  Also, this way Apple makes sure that non-native apps with poor overall experience won’t appear on Apple TV.</p>

<h2>Key takeaways</h2>
<ol>
<li>People mostly enjoy watching TV in a shared environment so, when creating a TV app, think about experiences that you can bring to a group of people.</li>
<li>Touch or click interactions that people are used to on other devices are now focus-based. Use the remote’s touch surface, accelerometer, and gyroscope to help people feel connected to your app even though they’re sitting at a distance.</li>
<li>You can build a fully customized interface for your app but do refer to Apple’s recommendations on grid parameters, interface component sizes, spacing, typography and layout templates to make sure your content is easy to browse at a distance and navigate quickly with the remote.</li>
</ol>

<p id="cba9" class="graf--p graf--first">Transplant Hero is a medication reminder app that is the brainchild of Dr. Jay A. Graham, a transplant surgeon in New York. It helps transplant patients follow a strict anti-rejection medicine regimen after an organ transplantation. At Stanfy in collaboration with our client Dr. Graham we designed the iPhone app experience, created a name and a logo for the product, and finally brought the solution to the iOS marketplace.</p>
<p id="d2c2" class="graf--p">In this post I would like to share with you our design process and lessons learned. Together, we put our whole collective heart and soul into this project and even if Transplant Hero can prevent one rejection — it was well worth it!</p>
<h2 id="e0f5" class="graf--h3">Understanding the problem</h2>
<p id="02fa" class="graf--p">After an organ transplant, patients need to take immunosuppressant drugs that help prevent their immune systems from attacking the new organ. Typically, the drugs must be taken for the patients’ lifetimes, at all hours of the day and night from two to four times a day.</p>
<p id="f032" class="graf--p">This creates a serious challenge for patients — research shows that 15% of graft losses happen due to immunosuppression non-compliance. In 2014 alone around 30 000 transplants were <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/converge/latestData/step2.asp" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/converge/latestData/step2.asp">performed in the US</a>. That means that around 4500 of them may have serious problems due to medication non-adherence.</p>
<p id="934b" class="graf--p">Why are the numbers so high? Why do people whose lives depend on the tiny pills keep breaking their medication regimens and repeatedly forgetting to take pills on time? Why don’t existing reminder apps help?</p>
<p class="graf--p"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9745" src="https://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TH-2-1024x264.jpeg" alt="TH 2" width="800" height="206" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH-2-1024x264.jpeg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH-2-300x77.jpeg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH-2-768x198.jpeg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH-2-600x155.jpeg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH-2-450x116.jpeg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH-2-1000x258.jpeg 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH-2.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h2 id="defb" class="graf--h3">Understanding the people</h2>
<p id="94f3" class="graf--p">Our design process starts with the people we are designing for and ends with the solution that suits their needs. Research is a reliable way to gain insight into people’s’ lives and to create a compelling experience for them.</p>
<p id="7f33" class="graf--p">For this project we chose to conduct generative research with the goal of stepping into transplant patients’ shoes, to understand their lives and solve problems from their perspectives, and to to find answers to such questions as:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="2f8c" class="graf--li">What is the exact problem we are solving?</li>
<li id="f2c1" class="graf--li">Who are we building this for?</li>
<li id="cddb" class="graf--li">What is the context in which our users will interact with what we are designing?</li>
</ul>
<p class="graf--p"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9746" src="https://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TH-3-1024x331.jpeg" alt="TH 3" width="824" height="266" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH-3-1024x331.jpeg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH-3-300x97.jpeg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH-3-768x248.jpeg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH-3-600x194.jpeg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH-3-450x145.jpeg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH-3-1000x323.jpeg 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH-3.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 824px) 100vw, 824px" /></p>
<p id="e185" class="graf--p">The research included a series of informal interviews with patients and a subject matter expert (the transplant surgeon), and a review of existing literature.</p>
<p id="16ca" class="graf--p">We asked transplant patients about a variety of topics, including their lives before the surgery, how they changed after, difficulties they are experiencing in relation with their medication regimen, and their computer and mobile habits.</p>
<h3 class="graf--p">The interviews allowed us to get the following valuable insights:</h3>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="2ba4" class="graf--li">The patient’s life is changing dramatically for the better within several weeks after the surgery.</li>
<li id="10c4" class="graf--li">Within weeks of leaving the hospital patients find that that they have more energy and the world has become “brighter”.</li>
<li id="79d0" class="graf--li">During the first several months patients feel overwhelmed with information; they need to learn about their new organ, how to take care about it, and how to avoid rejection and infection.</li>
<li id="b86d" class="graf--li">Patients hardly notice that they miss their anti-rejection medicine sometimes.</li>
<li id="16c1" class="graf--li">Transplant patients often treat the day of the surgery as their second birthday.</li>
<li class="graf--li">Patients do forget about taking their pills on time even though they fully realize that it may cause the rejection of their transplant organ.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="78c2" class="graf--h3">Defining the vision</h2>
<p id="93a4" class="graf--p">Our next step was to transform our research into meaningful and actionable insights that would become the foundation for the design.</p>
<p class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">At this stage we were looking for answers to these questions:</strong></p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="c4d8" class="graf--li">What should we make?</li>
<li id="e4c2" class="graf--li">How should it work?</li>
<li id="27ee" class="graf--li">Why should people care?</li>
</ul>
<p>We conducted several ideation sessions within the team and the client to make sense of what we learned and come up with experience and design principles for the product.</p>
<h3 id="7066" class="graf--h4">Experience Principles and Design Criteria</h3>
<ul>
<li id="5218" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Transplant Hero is your smart guide to the anti-rejection medicine. </strong>It minimises the patient’s work on medications setup and does the heavy work on proper pill scheduling.</li>
<li id="059e" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Be a friend, not a doctor. </strong>Transplant Hero builds a personal connection with the patients and encourages them to follow the medication regimen. By taking medications regularly a patient is rewarded by fun and cool awards.</li>
<li id="9888" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Transplant Hero is all about transplant patients and their medications. </strong>It anticipates the medications needs of the transplant patients and content that is universal for the transplant patients is predefined.</li>
<li id="d3d3" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Transplant Hero is the bright part of your post-transplant life. </strong>The application’s visual language emphasizes the new, energetic patient’s life, far away from a hospital.</li>
</ul>
<p id="d9b0" class="graf--p">The application inspires, encourages, and gently but persistently prompts patients about their medications times.</p>
<h2 id="7320" class="graf--h3">Designing the experience</h2>
<p id="fbcc" class="graf--p">Once we identified opportunities for design we started sketching out concepts quickly to illustrate the user experience with our app and prototype several possible experience solutions.</p>
<h3 id="4b70" class="graf--h4">The Engagement Flow</h3>
<p id="c840" class="graf--p">A big part of our discussions was the “engagement flow”, the “secret sauce” of the Transplant Hero that is supposed to get patients to stick with the app and seamlessly, playfully help them to get used to keeping track of all of their medications.</p>
<p class="graf--p"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9754 size-full" src="https://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TH8.png" alt="TH8" width="700" height="700" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH8.png 700w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH8-150x150.png 150w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH8-300x300.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH8-600x600.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH8-450x450.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<p class="graf--p">Eventually we came up with the flow that involves the user in the game and challenges him to earn cool rewards towards eventually becoming a Transplant Super Hero.</p>
<p class="graf--p"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9756" src="https://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TH9-1024x480.jpeg" alt="TH9" width="800" height="375" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH9-1024x480.jpeg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH9-300x141.jpeg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH9-768x360.jpeg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH9-600x281.jpeg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH9-450x211.jpeg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH9-1000x469.jpeg 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH9.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h2 id="efd0" class="graf--h4">Minimal Viable Product (MVP)</h2>
<p id="6f24" class="graf--p">Our goal for the first release of the app was to design and develop a minimal viable version of the product that:</p>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="cb2f" class="graf--li">would cover the main user needs,</li>
<li id="7bcf" class="graf--li">would engage users;</li>
<li id="5cc8" class="graf--li">would be created with reasonable amount of efforts and investments;</li>
<li id="e2a5" class="graf--li">allow us to gain feedback and learn how to improve the app.</li>
</ul>
<p id="ff94" class="graf--p">We decided to focus on two basic uses:</p>
<p class="graf--p"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9758 size-full" src="https://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TH10.jpeg" alt="TH10" width="782" height="341" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH10.jpeg 782w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH10-300x131.jpeg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH10-768x335.jpeg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH10-600x262.jpeg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH10-450x196.jpeg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 782px) 100vw, 782px" /></p>
<h3 id="30e8" class="graf--h3">Creating a design prototype</h3>
<p id="1d54" class="graf--p">Following the design criteria that we agreed on before we came up with the user interface concept for the application.</p>
<p class="graf--p"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9759" src="https://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TH11.jpeg" alt="TH11" width="800" height="725" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH11.jpeg 1020w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH11-300x272.jpeg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH11-768x696.jpeg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH11-600x544.jpeg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH11-450x408.jpeg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH11-1000x906.jpeg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p class="graf--p">Than we applied a little bit of color magic and here is our beautiful Transplant Hero!</p>
<p class="graf--p"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9760" src="https://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TH12-1024x701.jpeg" alt="TH12" width="700" height="479" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH12-1024x701.jpeg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH12-300x205.jpeg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH12-768x526.jpeg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH12-600x411.jpeg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH12-450x308.jpeg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH12-1000x685.jpeg 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH12.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></p>
<h3 id="c80a" class="graf--h3">Defining the key product metrics</h3>
<blockquote id="5b71" class="graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote"><p><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">“Don’t just ask questions. Know how the answers to the questions will change your behavior,” Alistair Croll stated in Lean Analytics.</em></p></blockquote>
<p id="5768" class="graf--p">The metrics that we will choose to track over time should help us to make design decisions and avoid unnecessary implementation efforts. Also the clear set of metrics allows us to indicate the progress of our product.</p>
<p id="8bfc" class="graf--p">In Transplant Hero one of the most important goals is in the engagement category: <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">we want our users to “checkin” all their meds every day.</strong> To identify this we need to calculate the ratio between checked in and prescribed medications.</p>
<p id="7ddd" class="graf--p">Other information that is also important for us is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">understanding what stops patients from becoming our regular users.</strong> To do this we can track the retention rate, how many of the active users from a given time period are still present in some later time period.</p>
<p class="graf--p">The third issue that is important is <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">the percentage of users who installed the app and successfully went through the medication setup flow. </strong>This can give us a hint about what turns off some users from the app at the very first launch (fears, questions they may have) and how we can improve that.</p>
<p class="graf--p"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9761" src="https://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TH13-1024x345.jpeg" alt="TH13" width="800" height="270" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH13-1024x345.jpeg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH13-300x101.jpeg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH13-768x259.jpeg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH13-600x202.jpeg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH13-450x152.jpeg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH13-1000x337.jpeg 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH13.jpeg 1400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h4 id="52d8" class="graf--h4">Key metrics:</h4>
<ul class="postList">
<li id="7921" class="graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Missed rate per active* user per week </strong>— the ratio between checked in and prescribed medications (by active user we mean a user who checked in at least one medication during the last 7 days)</li>
<li id="b20f" class="graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Retention rate per user per week</strong> — percentage of users who are active after 7 days</li>
<li id="08bd" class="graf--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Activation rate per user per week</strong> — percentage of users who successfully scheduled their medications</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a08d" class="graf--h3">Build it. Learn. Iterate</h2>
<p id="bcc3" class="graf--p">In development we followed the Agile process and it took us about 5 one-week sprints to release the first version of the app.</p>
<p id="5d72" class="graf--p">The flexibility of Agile and the ability to test the app every week gave us a chance to improve the user experience and refine some ideas during the development cycle. As a result, the scope has grown but together with that it has allowed us to deliver a better product.</p>
<p class="graf--p"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9762" src="https://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TH14.png" alt="TH14" width="800" height="293" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH14.png 877w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH14-300x110.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH14-768x281.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH14-600x220.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH14-450x165.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p class="graf--p">Almost immediately after the app went public we started to gather feedback from the early users and learn.</p>
<p class="graf--p"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9763" src="https://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TH15.jpeg" alt="TH15" width="600" height="396" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH15.jpeg 908w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH15-300x198.jpeg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH15-768x507.jpeg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH15-600x396.jpeg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH15-450x297.jpeg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p id="eda8" class="graf--p">For example, together with the client we found out that the majority of the patients don’t religiously follow the doctor’s prescriptions and prefer to customize their medications schedule. Other patients have specific needs to schedule medications every other day or have different dosages in the morning and evening time.</p>
<p id="e41a" class="graf--p">This feedback contradicts our research findings and the design principles that we defined for the app — that the app should do all the “heavy lifting” on scheduling medications. As such, it meant we needed to pivot and adjust to our user expectations.</p>
<p id="c99e" class="graf--p">At this point we have released three new versions of Transplant Hero that take into account these specific needs of transplant patients and we continue to listen and to learn.</p>
<p id="199d" class="graf--p">On the bright side — we are getting overwhelmingly positive feedback from people who love the app and it encourages us to see that we are on the right track!</p>
<p class="graf--p"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9764" src="https://stanfy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TH16-1024x331.jpeg" alt="TH16" width="800" height="258" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH16-1024x331.jpeg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH16-300x97.jpeg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH16-768x248.jpeg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH16-600x194.jpeg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH16-450x145.jpeg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH16-1000x323.jpeg 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TH16.jpeg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p id="94b4" class="graf--p">Just in one month after the launch, Transplant Hero has been selected as a Platinum Award winner of the Best Mobile App Awards, under the category of the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://devmindgroup.com/blog/transplant-hero-has-won-the-platinum-award-for-best-mobile-app-user-interface/" rel="nofollow" data-href="https://stanfy.com/blog/transplant-hero-has-won-the-platinum-award-for-best-mobile-app-user-interface/">“Best Mobile App User Interface”</a>!</p>
