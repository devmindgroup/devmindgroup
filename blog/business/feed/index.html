										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">Over the past 20 years, advanced technologies and innovations have changed the way the hospitality industry brings value to travelers around the world. With all the opportunities, digital transformation is reshaping the industry, leaving some players behind, customers’ behavior has shifted with astonishing speed towards new, innovative experiences.</p>
<p>Digital transformation is, no doubt, one of the key drivers of industry growth today. But since the sudden COVID-19 pandemic outbreak hit the “pause button” hard-full stop, the hospitality industry especially is losing its positions day after day.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, consumers always continue to demand improved solutions and unique experiences. The industry is rapidly adopting new technologies to exceed their expectations and digitize the customer journey with one-tap check-ins, digital concierge services, voice-activated devices, chatbots, smart in-room technologies, advanced analytics, virtual-assistant platforms, enhanced direct bookings, and more to come.</p>
<h1>Travel. Transformed.</h1>
<p>Many companies from the hospitality industry are still only entering the new exciting world of digitalization. To create a more seamless guest experience, more hotels automate and streamline the travel processes, developing the advanced tools necessary to capture the full potential of data.</p>
<p>Moreover, considering that millennials are increasingly dominating the travel sector, hospitality companies should be prepared to curate and personalized travel offerings and to make a data-enabled transformation work. This generation of tech-savvy travelers prefers using apps for bookings and getting more personalized interactions. The cultural change, as well as the long-term impact of automation, machine learning, and even robotics, are here to stay.</p>
<p>Devmind’s experts have developed an in-depth overview of digital transformation trends in hospitality and what to expect from hotels of the future presented in this infographics:</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k-6AmwRmbZQAAV0eNxeQWn3j8Jv-18m4/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19259" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotels-of-the-Future-Digital-Transformation-in-Hospitality-min.png" alt="dt in hospitality " width="2128" height="7055" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotels-of-the-Future-Digital-Transformation-in-Hospitality-min.png 2128w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotels-of-the-Future-Digital-Transformation-in-Hospitality-min-309x1024.png 309w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotels-of-the-Future-Digital-Transformation-in-Hospitality-min-768x2546.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotels-of-the-Future-Digital-Transformation-in-Hospitality-min-463x1536.png 463w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotels-of-the-Future-Digital-Transformation-in-Hospitality-min-618x2048.png 618w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotels-of-the-Future-Digital-Transformation-in-Hospitality-min-600x1989.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotels-of-the-Future-Digital-Transformation-in-Hospitality-min-136x450.png 136w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Hotels-of-the-Future-Digital-Transformation-in-Hospitality-min-302x1000.png 302w" sizes="(max-width: 2128px) 100vw, 2128px" /></a></p>

<h1>What’s next</h1>
<p>Some things never change. Companies powered by data and advanced technologies will always be driven by people. Hospitality organizations are no different. They have to keep pace and grow into agile, reinvent themselves to become more relevant, and deliver engaging customer experiences.</p>
<p>Leaders have to bring to the fore some fundamental questions about values, cultural changes, privacy, and cybersecurity if they want to keep up with automation and machine learning solutions.</p>
<p>We empower companies and their hospitality workforce with tools like travel AI and chatbots, and data-driven insights to transform into intelligent operations. Are you and your organization ready to shift the mindsets and get the most out of innovations?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The business impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on industries across the world is now profound. Leaders and CIOs should rev up their digital business strategies and position themselves for growth when the pandemic subsides. How exactly should leaders manage this impact and get the most out of opportunities? Here’s our answer.</p>

<p>Today, for the global sectors, COVID-19 presents two challenges: largely idled sectors disrupting trade and reduced demand from consumers. A few examples to consider, Chile is reeling from reduced copper demand. Germany — from auto parts shortage.</p>
<p>In this article, we examine how different industries react to business and economic turbulence caused by the novel pandemic through innovation and digital capabilities. We discover this through <b>the example of 8 industries that try to win over the battle using digital and innovation capabilities.</b></p>
<h2 id="healthcare"><b>Healthcare</b></h2>
<p>As each industry emerges from its acute response phase, many will find that they are entering a “new normal.” Expect the way healthcare is practiced and marketed to be no different.</p>
<p>Beyond the negative impact of a traditional economic downturn, COVID-19 presents additional challenges — fear from the virus itself, collective grief, prolonged physical distancing, and associated social isolation — that will compound the impact on our collective <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/helping-us-healthcare-stakeholders-understand-the-human-side-of-the-covid-19-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">health</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19717" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3.jpg" alt="stress Covid" width="1200" height="699" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3.jpg 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-1024x596.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-768x447.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-600x350.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-450x262.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-1000x583.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Reported signs of distress related to COVID-19 in the US.</i></p>
<p>As the way healthcare is practiced evolves, so too will the environment and platforms through which that care is delivered. There will be new needs that emerge; new content will be needed, in new formats, manifesting in new marketing assets.</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in Healthcare and Other Solutions</h3>
<p>There are three areas that healthcare marketing leaders should focus on, as the impact on their business and the subsequent need to adapt will be significant:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Telehealth</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital/telehealth-53-growing-faster-any-other-place-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acceptance and utilization of telehealth</a> services within the US were already on a sharp incline before the COVID-19 crisis erupted countrywide.  Since then, medical and municipal leaders are leveraging the platform as a tool in combating the spread of COVID-19, accelerating adoption in the process.</p>
<p>From a Payer perspective, CVS Health, Aetna, Cigna, and United Health are just a few of the payer organizations recommending patients move to virtual care – going so far as to waive copays for utilizing the service.</p>
<p>Consumers are showing increased interest as well, with <a href="https://www.govtech.com/em/emergency-blogs/disaster-zone/what-are-people-searching-for-on-the-web--relating-to-covid-19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEMRush reporting</a> a 146.15% increase in searches for “in-home doctor visits” and a 53.97% increase in “in-home medical care” searches.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Urgent care</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Urgent Care Centers are quickly becoming the front door in a person’s treatment journey.  A study from the Urgent Care Association found that a median of<a href="https://www.ucaoa.org/About-UCA/Industry-News/ArtMID/10309/ArticleID/877/Booming-Urgent-Care-Industry-Filling-the-Gaps-in-Patient-Care" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 35% of patients utilizing UCCs</a> do not have primary care physicians, reflecting the fact that Healthcare is shifting to much more of an on-demand service. Medicare and Medicaid patients made up almost 27% of UCC patients in 2018, confirming that the shift is not driven only by the young or affluent.</p>
<p>The organization is flanking the physical services with digital efforts, with  <a href="https://cvshealth.com/thought-leadership/cvs-health-names-more-us-cities-for-healthhub-expansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">almost 30% of the landing pages</a> on CVS.com Minute Clinic specific. Not to be outdone, Walmart<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/business/walmart-health-care-clinics-amazon-cvs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> launched the first of its augmented health facilities</a> in September 2019.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Almost everything goes online</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Medical conferences and congresses are a huge priority for companies in the Health sector. These events are valued by commercial organizations, advocacy groups, and healthcare professionals as key opportunities for medical education, peer-to-peer engagement, and the release of official study data.</p>
<p>While some of those activities have been digitally distributed in parallel, a vast majority of that activity is face-to-face. The COVID-19 crisis is forcing digital transformation in healthcare industry to take new turns.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #1476f2;"><a style="color: #1476f2;" href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/platforms/healthcare"><b>Devmind Healthcare Solutions</b></a></span></h2>
<p>Since healthcare and economic environments force medical experts to take extra shifts, this greatly affects their own quality and safety of life.</p>
<p>The idea behind Devmind’s solution was to empower medical professionals with a simple tool that gives them flexibility, control, and more. We created an <b>on-demand healthcare staffing solution</b> consisting of two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">iOS and Android app with an Uber-like feel (for the Nurse role);</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Web Admin Panel (for Hospital Administrator or Security Supervisor role).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the most significant features included there are a nurse and hospital management, shift management, notification center, data export, etc. Solutions of this kind can be a major stride within the current time frames because they help doctors stay focused on more essential things and certain patients with reaching for treatments.</p>
<p>As consumers and organizations have no other choice, the COVID-19 crisis is accelerating the utilization of digital platforms. While there have been financial, behavioral, and attitudinal<a href="https://www.jdpower.com/sites/default/files/2019185_telehealth_usage_and_awareness.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> roadblocks</a> to adoption in the past, the need to overcome the crisis is superseding those roadblocks and increases the number of first-time users.</p>
<h2 id="entertainment"><b>E-commerce and Online Shopping</b></h2>
<p>Today, as B2B digital transformation statistics say, online shopping is the fastest-growing slice of the pie, dominating the scene and continuing to invest in digital capabilities.</p>
<p>Traditional, smaller players are also eyeing the online scene. Many traditional small markets have taken to online channels to hawk products, conduct online auctions, and even to carry out customer relation-building, for example, passing tips on how to prepare dishes using their products.</p>
<p>However, most authorities are warning organizations <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/interviews/coronavirus-spread-preparing-for-the-long-haul-i-4609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to prepare for the long haul</a>. Virtually every company involved in global trade feels the impact.</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in B2B E-commerce</h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Digitalization had swiftly come into B2B E-commerce sectors a long time ago. But since recent times the situation has drastically changed, the technologies and trends have changed too. Although some things remain untouchable. Still, most of the E-commerce sales are made through mobile devices (</span><a class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/806336/mobile-retail-commerce-share-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">73%</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">). Progressive Web App (PWA), with its native-app-like experience, is also here to stay.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Artificial intelligence, machine learning, personalized customer experience, and predefined analytics — all complement an evolution of B2B consumerization. Data remains the primary fuel for accelerating the development of any organization involved in sales. Focusing on eternal questions: what data to collect and how to process it effectively remains unsolved even today. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19718" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2.jpg" alt="social distancing" width="1200" height="1277" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2.jpg 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-282x300.jpg 282w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-962x1024.jpg 962w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-768x817.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-600x639.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-423x450.jpg 423w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-940x1000.jpg 940w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In response to social distancing, many businesses will make their E-commerce operations a key priority.</em></p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Here is what we suggest you can do right now to mitigate the impact of coronavirus on your E-commerce business:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Even as early digitalization investments are paying off, the current inability to fulfill delivery of online purchases suggests digitization efforts by businesses have only been focused at the customer-facing end. Supermarket chains should consider integrating their online shopping platforms with the stock-holding information of their physical branches.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 may accelerate the growth of the online grocery sector. People did not just flock to physical supermarkets, but also loaded virtual carts with groceries from online platforms. With government directives to allow workers to work-from-home and to avoid non-essential trips to shopping malls, this trend of online shopping is likely to persist.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Another possibility is for online shopping platforms to partner with businesses that specialize in delivery fulfillment such as UberEats, Grab, Glovo, and Bolt Food. B2B digital transformation trends are another milestone companies should consider today.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="entertainment"><b>Entertainment</b></h2>
<p>Around the world, COVID-19 is having a marked impact on media supply, consumption, and advertising. Demand for content-streamed, live, and multi-layered — is skyrocketing while new content creation has been largely turned off.</p>
<p>Since cinema and amusement parks across the globe are all shut down for uncertain times, thousands of entertainment organizations suffer formidable losses and fail to receive any kind of income. The outbreak triggered online entertainment and how some companies are finding ways to engage differently with consumers and the new reality.</p>

<h3>Digital Transformation in Entertainment</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for all forms of media — TV programs, short-form video, music streaming, and online gaming, particularly in geographies currently under stay-home instructions, has surged. Digital transformation in entertainment is expecting more new turns in the foreseen future.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The supply of new content may be limited to a few weeks for some formats (e.g., daytime dramas). New TV series currently being launched were completed prior to production sets shutting down.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Network resiliency and capacity continues to be a focus, as the demand for content surges. In the European Union, streaming platforms are reducing video quality to ensure networks are not overwhelmed and that customers can still view content.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">While sports companies come to terms with a wave of cancellations, many are seeking new ways to reach their customers digitally. Many are looking to eSports or online simulated events to provide content to fans, with even professional athletes engaging in eSports competitions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Musicians are going online and relying on streaming platforms as live shows are canceled.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="food"><b>Restaurants and Food delivery</b></h2>
<p>Despite some concerns, food delivery companies gain their momentum and become a popular option as people practice social distancing. It&#8217;s hard to pinpoint exactly how much growth there has been in this sector, but higher demand has led to <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/if-the-coronavirus-spreads-in-Zambia-food-delivery-companies-could-see-a-surge-in-demand-are-they-ready-2020-02-28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">higher pricing</a> in some areas. What more to expect?</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in Food Industry</h3>
<p>Uber, for example, recently provided Uber-only drivers with information on adding Uber Eats food deliveries to their services. Within the first week, around <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/increasing-earning-opportunities-with-uber-eats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15% of Uber drivers</a> had completed their first food delivery.</p>
<p>Fine dining establishments, small-town restaurants, and fast foods are now switching to offer delivery services to their customers. At the same time, restaurants that did not previously offer take-outs are now considering this option as never before. Some restaurants choose a third-party delivery service to partner with, and each offer comes with unique benefits.</p>

<p>Uber Eats and Deliveroo, among others, have launched contactless “leave at your door service” to help drivers and customers follow social distancing and quarantine rules.</p>
<p>In addition to understanding already in place strict food hygiene <a href="https://trans.info/en/covid-19-pandemic-triggers-surge-in-global-food-delivery-industry-178243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standards</a>, consumers may also be interested to learn if the businesses have:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">New practices for social distancing in the kitchen or during delivery pickups;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Policy for staff members who display symptoms of COVID-19;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Changes in food delivery guidelines, such as containers that allow for easier disinfection or better customer experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though it is uncertain where the digital transformation in food industry and the delivery trend will go in the post-COVID-19 era, many businesses are working as hard as they can to ensure they meet consumers’ expectations and remain relevant by providing an excellent service.</p>
<h2 id="industry"><b>IT &amp; Tech Industry</b></h2>
<p>The effects of COVID-19 and are having <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/covid-19/understanding-covid-19-s-impact-on-the-technology-sector-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a significant impact on the technology sector,</a> too. However, the disruption has caused reevaluation on organizations’ business continuity plans (BCPs) as well as the acceleration of remote operations and online meetings. Let&#8217;s dive in to see what has changed more and what solutions organizations appeal to remain afloat.</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in IT and Other Solutions</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Companies with remote-working technologies already see increased demand as organizations accelerate their remote-working capabilities.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Security software will see third-order benefits from a growing remote workforce. Organizations race to secure endpoints, cloud-based tools, log management, and VPNs. So, IT spending on security software will increase too.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19711" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-scaled.jpg" alt="home teacher" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to enhanced remote work scenarios, IT digital transformation will play a larger role in future BCPs. Thus, CIOs and senior management will need to ensure a resilient, secure network, disaster recovery systems, and more devices for the ones working remotely.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for ever-faster access to data and automation will drive the focus on network equipment and communications, speeding up 5G network and equipment introduction.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An increase in the use of tele- and video-conferencing software as more companies encourage employees to commute.</span></li>

<h2 id="construction"><b>Construction</b></h2>
<p>Today, the most vulnerable industries are those lacking digitalization and tech maturity. The construction industry is one of them.</p>
<p>Creating $1.3 trillion worth of structures each year only in the USA, the construction industry remains one of the most under-digitized industrial sectors. Longer-term construction companies <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/covid-19/covid-19-s-impact-on-industrial-products---construction-firms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">across the globe</a> will have to contend with decreased demand as governments face rising deficits, and residential and commercial projects are dampened by unemployment and low GDP growth.</p>
<p>To stay one step ahead of the crisis, the sector requires a different approach to the overall strategy. Digital transformation in construction industry is a burning topic for both — senior management and government. What are the solutions construction companies have today?</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Today, key questions executives and boards should be asking are: do we need to rethink our company’s digital strategy to remain financially solvent, and how can we use technology to gain operational leverage. And the digital transformation in the construction industry becomes inevitable.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19723" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/bbfb.png" alt="construction Covid" width="974" height="472" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/bbfb.png 974w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/bbfb-300x145.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/bbfb-768x372.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/bbfb-600x291.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/bbfb-450x218.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p>

<h2 id="hospitality"><b>Hospitality</b></h2>
<p>Hospitality is taking proactive financial steps to mitigate the huge impact. It’s obvious today, both revenue and supply chains will be affected the most. Hotels, restaurants, theme parks, cinemas all went silent. The entire disruptive effect of the hospitality industry will have a significant, tremendous impact on the global hospitality industry and economy. And there is a question hangs heavy in the air — can digital transformation in hospitality industry change the rule of the game?</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Despite this, hospitality shows its maturity level: in working together, showing their true hospitality commitments in helping out our society where they can. Technologies like artificial intelligence, big data, connected devices, virtual and augmented realities are shaping the hospitality industry as we speak.</p>

<p>Only during the last two decades dozens of industry disruptors, such as Airbnb, Skyscanner, and TripAdvisor, have appeared on the market. Companies and organizations are expected to get out of the crisis more digitally mature, and those ones who find enough strength to focus on digitalization — are going to win the race. Here are some of the steps to consider today:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">“We may be apart, but we&#8217;ll get through this together,” <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/?_set_bev_on_new_domain=1538581578_Ju69Wm%2FOxIW8lBSY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says Airbnb experts</a> introducing 50 new online experiences with unique activities for their customers. The home-sharing platform curates free online experiences to inspire people and stay afloat.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Digital transformation in the hospitality industry should now be focused on those that we know are available to travel. The dramatic rise in online gambling during COVID-19 lockdowns is one of the results of current circumstances. The online gambling industry is one of the winners of the current shutdown, and some offline casinos and other organizations can consider this as a potential opportunity for future growth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Smart automation confidently moved into the industry through the Internet of Things technology. It has improved not only the convenience and comfort standards for clients but also reduced costs for businesses and organizations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Robots that handle food preparation and delivery, predictive analytics, and cloud storage — are the next big moves for automation in the industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the COVID-19 shutdown has brought the industry to a standstill, it is also an opportunity for the companies to reevaluate their digital strategies and map out the right path ahead.</p>

Digital transformation in FinTech triggers a “Big Pocket” battle between incumbents and challengers to win the (newly) online customer. Financial Institutions turn to Tech companies rather than in-house solutions to accelerate digital transformation.</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">Mortgage and life insurance digitalization: leaping forward with technology to disrupt the role of intermediaries, whose role was often face-to-face.</li>
</ul>
<p>FinTech&#8217; enablers&#8217; around AI, IoT, and software solutions are in high demand:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">AI: bots for call-centers; account-opening procedures; loan automation;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">KYC: increased need for safe digital ID given volume of digital business transacted and robust solutions required for the protection of client assets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sensing">Sensing and Shaping the Post-COVID Era</h2>
<p>Crisis often leads to changes. This time is no exception. The shifts in social attitudes and behaviors we see today pave the broad path to new opportunities and ways of living and working. Some of which is here to stay with us in the long run. Some of which disappear right after the crisis is gone.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19716" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw.png" alt="crisis Covid" width="1209" height="550" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw.png 1209w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-300x136.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-1024x466.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-768x349.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-600x273.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-450x205.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-1000x455.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1209px) 100vw, 1209px" /></p>

<p>Nevertheless, some changes show a positive dynamic. For example, we see a greater focus on crisis preparedness, system resilience, social inequality, social solidarity, and access to health care. These attitudinal shifts could, in turn, be reflected in significant policy shifts in many areas, including trade, border controls, health care, crisis preparedness, foreign affairs, employment, and social welfare.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although the full impact of a novel pandemic is still unknown, many organizations are being impacted by the crisis domino effect, which reflects on employees, assets, operations, stakeholders, and even reputation.</p>
<p>Being proactive during disruption means that companies need to consider their business continuity preparedness activities and profound crisis management. This article is focused on risk identification and organizational exposure, on critical dependencies, and how to act pragmatically and effectively during crises and find resilience solutions.</p>
<p>In brief:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Destructive behavioral models: before implementing any IT crisis management approach, make sure you choose the most reasonable scenario to act.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">IT crisis management examples in theory and in practice.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Test and tried IT crisis management strategies and how to activate them in order to survive on the market.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Crisis management in IT project: Dangerous behavioral models</h2>
<p>Humans manage IT businesses, so managers are likely to choose natural reactions in crisis. And this is dangerous! Such subconscious sweet escapes lead to controversial consequences to the companies. So, before trying any IT crisis management approach, ensure your behavior is not destructive first.</p>
<p>Psychologists distinguish three natural reactions to stress:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fight,</li>
<li>Flight, or</li>
<li>Freeze.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these behaviors are not rational but instinct-based. Thus, they significantly complicate your ability to succeed in crisis management in IT projects. But there is some good news: once acknowledged, you can neutralize them.</p>
<p>So, check yourself by completing our quick test.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19468" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6.png" alt="fight freeze" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-6-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>1. A person who fights in a crisis</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You check the news and see what this world is coming to. Oil, financial crisis, coronavirus, worldwide quarantine, etc. This uncontrollable destruction makes you furious.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Your common reaction to stress is arguing and rejecting the severity of the problem. You’re likely to think, “This coronavirus is just the flu. I prefer to disregard, close my eyes, and keep on working as usual.”</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, you keep setting ambitious business aims, negotiating new strategies, and publishing aggressive ads.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve recognized yourself in this type of personality, calm down first. Everything will be back soon, but you need to act accordingly. We&#8217;re all victims of the circumstances here. In a crisis, we need to be even more flexible as usual. Don&#8217;t be stubborn, or the world will crush you down.</p>
<h3>2. A person who flight in a crisis</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Once you face danger, you feel the urge to disappear. If the problems are increasing like a snow avalanche, you lose control over the situation. The severity of a crisis frightens you.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In a stressful situation, you want to close your eyes, run away from the city, and disappear with your family (or alone).</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, you feel the urge to quit all the operational processes and cut all the costs. This may sound reasonable. But once uncontrolled, this behavior turns into destruction. And your team can find a strong reason to call you a deceiver.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re an escapist, realize that’s your unconscious behavior. Next time you feel the urge to run, just pause and take a deep breath. Remember: in crisis, your company needs a new strategy, and your team needs a real leader. If you choose to run away, you sign the death of your business.</p>
<h3>3. A person who freezes in a crisis</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In any uncontrollable situation, you can’t decide how to react. You feel paralyzed and literally freeze in one place.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">You can’t act until you see what the next move the majority takes.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">As a business owner, you prefer to change nothing and see what happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>Among these three instinctive reactions, freezing is the most reasonable scenario in shock. You don’t keep setting high aims in inappropriate circumstances. You&#8217;re not the one who closes everything and gives up without fighting. But you’re destroying your business if you literally sit and do nothing.</p>
<p>Whichever your natural reaction is, keep going slowly. And think of restructuring the business according to the new rules. It’s a high time to think of new opportunities, time-honored outsourcing strategies, and your life after the crisis.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19469" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8.png" alt="life after crisis" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-8-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>4. I’m not fighting, running, or freezing. What’s my IT crisis management plan?</h3>
<p>Once you become aware of your instincts and ready to do a careful analysis, don’t expect to get a ready-to-use recipe from any article. When it comes to crisis management, any decision is tailor-made. Still, there are some common sense IT crisis management practices that work both in crisis and stable time. In this harsh reality, it’s time to remind them.</p>
<p>Remember the test above: the biggest mistake is to make any sudden movements. All your crisis decisions are contextual. Their magic power will end once people come back to the streets, and the world economy recovers. Of course, you can gain some profit by catching the moment today &#8211; but you will need to reinvent something in the long run. If you want to invest today in the future, think of the proper policies, technologies, and cost optimization approaches.</p>
<h2>Crisis management examples: Theory and Practice</h2>
<p>You can come back to books, searching for previously developed scenarios of how to act in today’s crisis. But they won’t help you. Nobody predicted the unique combination of all current troubles before &#8211; health threat because of coronavirus, social threat because of quarantine, and economic threat because of the financial crisis. You can collect the pieces of useful information in books, but nobody can tell you what to do exactly.</p>
<p>In its turn, the contemporary business practice has already shown one reliable truth: when all the expenses are rearranged, there’s one category that isn’t cut at any cost. This is digitalization, the constant driver for the innovations. When everybody is self-isolated, the Internet is the only communication channel left. And the demand for greater digitalization can be put at the core of IT crisis management strategic recovery for 2020.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19470" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7.png" alt="recovery for 2020" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/3-7-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Digitalization is a form of cooperation that can both save an offline company in these hard times and become a center of IT crisis management strategy.</h3>
<p>Once forced to become remote or die, the businesses will try their best to cover the lack of digital tools. To survive, many managers stop useless spending and turn to investing in their added business value. And here, IT companies become extremely helpful to them. Software is a solution for various offline operations needed today. The remote developers can create a fast and efficient delivery for coffee shops, implement an app for outfits from showrooms or orchestrate the remote working process for an office team. IT can manage the crisis by covering the basic demand for digitalization under the new market rules, in short.</p>
<p>With a proper mindset, a crisis is always an opportunity. But don’t be in a rush to catch any of them while in crisis.</p>
<h3>Think of cost optimization, not cost-cutting</h3>
<p>To survive and become great again, check if you’re ready for three IT directions on which future pivots:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Relying on remote workplace optimization and dedicated development team creation,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Adopting various forms of business process outsourcing &#8211; a traditional software development outsourcing company or its alternative forms: offshore software development, nearshore software development, or an outstaffing company,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Implementing shared services and establishing effective collaboration models.</li>
</ol>
<p>All these models have been effective and highly recommended for all the companies during the last couple of years. But today, they are likely to help you stand this storm and become stronger after the crisis.</p>
<p>They work if only you had started adopting them before coronavirus conquered the world, of course.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19471" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8.png" alt="action course" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/4-8-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Remote workplace and dedicated development teams</h3>
<p>People all over the world stay home, but the majority of them keep working remotely. For years, remote developers have been hippies &#8211; but during quarantine, managers see the true value of a dedicated development team. The current situation is an opportunity for IT companies to organize micromanagement processes more effectively and build a team of highly motivated and talented people who can stand any crisis.</p>
<h3>Software development outsourcing company or the power of new collaboration models</h3>
<p>Introducing outsourcing software development is an effective strategy both in crisis and long after it passes. By finding a proper balance between in-house activities and outsourced operations, the cost optimization approach shows its best.</p>
<h3>Requesting offshore software development services (or how to optimize your expenses with offshore software development cost)</h3>
<p>Offshore model is among the real solutions to cost optimization during this crisis. This way, an offshore software development company can effectively reduce expenses for keeping an in-house team. Also, it allows fast hiring and fast scaling, which ensures the needed flexibility during the crisis.</p>
<h3>Nearshore software development model and IT outstaffing</h3>
<p>When you work remotely, the exact form of cooperation and the geographical location of your developers doesn’t matter that much. Additionally, you don’t need a separate budget to maintain an office. These models ensure high flexibility: they are project-based, provide managed services, and enable fast time-to-market delivery during the quarantine.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19472" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6.png" alt="delivery chain" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/5-6-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>Crisis management steps: Two strategic moves that will help you survive</h3>
<p>Let’s deal with it: you cannot change anything dramatically in the current situation. The best to do is to freeze and think of optimizing your costs. In the end, the 2020 crisis is nothing but a mistake to live through.</p>
<p>While steadily dealing with it, aim at reaching these two strategic goals:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Diversify your portfolio. Never depend on one product or project. Never rely on offline only, be ready to switch to another business development direction once needed. Prepare yourself for the worst scenario, and this will save your nerves and income figures.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Always have a rainy day fund. Your employees can live without extra entertainment in stable times &#8211; but in crisis, they will be happy to receive their salaries on time and not being fired.</li>
</ol>
<p>These strategies should be constant and gain different appearances in various IT processes. For example, you can teach your team the basics of remote productivity in stable times &#8211; and your remote developers will leave the next crisis more united than all in-house workers after quarantine. Cooperating with an outstaffing company in advance will teach your business to work with external collaborators and save your money for keeping in-house talents.</p>
<p>Remain constant in digitalization, no matter what tomorrow brings. Your digital workplace lives here.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19473" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4.png" alt="digital workplace" width="1200" height="473" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4.png 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-1024x404.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-768x303.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-600x237.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-450x177.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/6-4-1000x394.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<h3>How two crisis management strategies will help you succeed in the future: The secret ingredient and the final thought</h3>
<p>Once you learn from today’s bitter experience, you are ready for future crises. But any tactical and strategic step won’t work without the proper background. The fundamental trait is the strength of your IT brand.</p>
<p>Your clients should love you and be ready to help once you need it. Invest in this, and enjoy the magic of their support.</p>
<p>Keep calm, optimize your costs, and be valuable by yourself. This way, you will survive any crisis.</p>

<p>Digital demands are impacting leaders’ choices in a crowded, competitive construction market that is literally losing its positions by the day.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The profound humanitarian fallout of the COVID-19 continues to expand by the day. Governments have launched unprecedented public-health and economic responses. Companies have developed and implemented business continuity plans, security guidance, and, most importantly — seamless remote working conditions. In this article, we offer some of Devmind’s latest insights of managing a team of remote developers during times like this.</p>
<h1><b>How To Manage Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis</b></h1>
<p>So here we are, living in a world where pandemic movies came to life. The number of ill people is rising, as well as the level of stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>Since March 16, our employees have been working remotely. We have already faced all the possible difficulties on our way and learned how to tackle the main challenges to manage the working process smart and effectively. We are ready to spill the beans and share all the secrets of productive remote management.</p>
<p>To stop COVID-19, all the countries around the world are trying to minimize human interactions, resulting in <strong>a staggering number of employees learning how to work remotely</strong>. Even though the majority of software engineers are not new to work like this, it can still be quite a challenge to manage a team in such difficult times psychologically.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19392 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-scaled.jpg" alt="How To Manage Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/computer-desk-electronics-indoors-374074-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p>That is why in this article, we are going to shed light on ten tips to organize an effective working process with remote developers, taking into account both psychological pitfalls and practical hurdles to overcome.</p>
<h2><b>How to Manage a Team of Remote Developers Despite the Uncertainty</b></h2>
<p>First and foremost, you need to outline all the possible challenges your software development team may face when working from home. Usually, it boils down to three main challenges. These are communication problems and pitfalls, lack of well-functioned equipment, and the inability to manage productivity.</p>
<p>For this reason, before setting out the rules, guidelines, and software development team goals, make sure you did your best to eliminate or alleviate the possible struggles that may occur.</p>
<h2><b>10 Tips To Keep Your Developers Team Effective During the Coronavirus Crisis</b></h2>
<p>Luckily, we have already examined the best cases of smart and efficient remote developers management and prepared a quick guide for you to follow. We have taken into consideration the main challenges that can be difficult to tackle and offering comprehensive solutions to the problem. Take a look and enjoy the tips that truly work.</p>
<h3><b>1. Secure a Well-Functioned Tech Facilities and Tools</b></h3>
<p>Firstly, you need some software that will unite all the working processes. To ensure productivity, you’d better have a look at <strong>various collaboration tools perfect for a software development team working remotely.</strong>  Such tools as <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/ru/software/jira" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jira</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/?&amp;aceid=&amp;adposition=&amp;adgroup=77960797405&amp;campaign=1495118561&amp;creative=389415003358&amp;device=c&amp;keyword=trello&amp;matchtype=e&amp;network=g&amp;placement=&amp;ds_kids=p48956357108&amp;ds_e=GOOGLE&amp;ds_eid=700000001557344&amp;ds_e1=GOOGLE&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw1Iv0BRDaARIsAGTWD1u6J2htFRXh6wNFyzNse_aL_oTmPCvKEjPuVZYAT10fuV645yZsumIaAieOEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trello</a>, <a href="https://zoom.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom</a> enable us to stay focused on daily tasks, plan and manage projects. Slack helps our team to stay connected all the time. It’s the place where we <a href="https://www.groovehq.com/blog/remote-team-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brainstorm</a> and solve current issues. And Zoom, as a perfect alternative to Skype, is a way more convenient tool to have video calls and screen sharing.</p>
<p>What is more, there are tons of <a href="https://brainhub.eu/blog/tools-for-remote-development-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">productivity tools</a> that are both efficient and have friendly interfaces like Todoist, iDoneThis, and Atlassian Stash. With the help of such systems, it is much easier to have an overall picture needed when working remotely.</p>
<h3><b>2. Make Sure Your Staff Have Everything for Effective Work</b></h3>
<p>But for the obvious essentials like a well-function computer or a laptop and great Internet connection, one should think through all the possible hurdles on the way to a smooth remote working process. Ensure that you have <strong>a backup to the cloud in case there is any accidental deletion of valuable files. </strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, your workers need to have “<a href="https://www.upwork.com/hiring/development/secure-collaboration-remote-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">access</a> to servers, development environments, and shared code.” Otherwise, your software developers teams will just stumble upon inconveniences that could lower their productivity.</p>
<h3><b>3. Think Through Communication Channels</b></h3>
<p>Even though many people hate these real face-to-face meetings, during such gatherings, you can communicate fast, transmit your ideas fast, and, most importantly, solve the existing problems fast. When working with remote developers, it is vital to have <strong>regular video meetings.</strong> Not only will regular conferences reduce the problem with the lack of information, but they also help to unite workers and show they are all in this together.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-19388 size-full" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-scaled.jpg" alt="Think Through Communication Channels During Coronavirus Crisis" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/woman-in-white-crew-neck-shirt-wearing-brown-framed-3768161-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<h3><b>4. Help Your Workers With Self-Organization</b></h3>
<p>If you want your developers’ team to be productive, you need to show them the importance of <strong>self-organization and discipline</strong>. Teach them to stay online during the working day. What is more, be a great example and don’t bother them with work issues at weekends and when the working day has ended.</p>
<p>Explain that the remote work schedule is no different from work in the office, and this is actually the good news. The reason is simple: you work the same amount of time, but you don’t waste your time commuting, for instance. What is more, psychologically it is less stressful when you do your job within the agreed time period, having no put offs, and then just relax after the work is done.</p>
<h3><b>5. Set Software Development Team Roles and Responsibilities</b></h3>
<p>Make sure both formal and informal roles are distributed effectively so that each employee knows exactly what their responsibilities are. When working remotely, a team <strong>“can truly benefit from having informal roles like various kinds of leaders, idea generators, critics, and doers”</strong>, as it is the key to self-management.</p>
<p>Plus, it is worth mentioning that to maximize productivity, you’d better build small teams of <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/how-manage-remote-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">3-8 people</a>. Such teams are more autonomous, take responsibility for their initiatives, and as a result, are more efficient. In case you’re developing a big project, you can always divide one team into sub-teams.</p>
<h3><b>6. Keep Everyone Updated</b></h3>
<p>When working together on one project, it is crucial that <strong>all the members are in the loop</strong>, especially in the case of remote developers. For this reason, once again, think through regular conference meetings to discuss the relevant issues. Knowing the status of other projects, or being aware of any changes in the company’s goals and objectives is all crucial to an employee working remotely. That is why ensure that nobody is missing out on anything.</p>
<h3><b>7. Encourage Open Conversation </b></h3>
<p>Let us face reality, COVID-19 is not the usual flu, and it has been a long time since the last serious pandemic. That is why all the people are feeling stressed, anxious, and some can even get depressed. An employer or HR manager encourages open conversation with your workers. Make sure you ask your workers how they feel.</p>
<p><strong>“It is <a href="https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/7-tips-for-working-fsuccessfully-managing-remote-teams.html?cid=search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">believed</a> that the main struggle remote workers face is the feeling of loneliness and isolation”.</strong> For this reason, it would be a great idea to offer an opportunity for an online session with the psychologist. After all, you are working with people, and their emotional and physical being is the main priority.</p>
<h3><b>8. Remind About Data Protection</b></h3>
<p>Ensure that your employees are informed about protecting data. Remind them that it isn’t advisable to transfer work data, materials, and emails to their personal devices without permission. In case they do not have any other choice but to work on their personal laptop or computer, make sure that they <strong>take all the necessary precautions</strong> like antivirus software or not letting the browsers save some work passwords, for instance.</p>
<p>What is more, you should ensure <a href="https://intersog.com/blog/software-teams/how-to-keep-your-remote-software-development-team-safe-and-secure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">secure connections</a> with VPN, as well as adopt smart and secure cloud storage solutions.</p>

<h3><b>9. Trust Your Developers Team</b></h3>
<p>If you want to create a comfortable and efficient working environment, it is not about tracking and monitoring productivity all the time or comparing the performance. <strong>It is about believing in your team</strong>, talking to them, and taking an interest in what bothers them. After all, it does not matter whether you work from home or stay in the office. If a team achieves the required outcome, it means they are doing a great job.</p>
<h3><b>10. Goals Are the Priority, Not Activity</b></h3>
<p>According to Forbes contributor Donal Hatter, who specializes in sales and effective leadership, <strong>it is crucial to focus on the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescoachescouncil/2018/05/30/top-15-tips-to-effectively-manage-remote-employees/#62a35f47503c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">objectives</a> when working with a remote team.</strong> He believes that productivity boils down to the results having been achieved, rather than what is being done. For this reason, the last tip is to focus on the goals you want to achieve with your team and work towards them no matter the obstacles.</p>
<h1><b>How to Motivate and Manage Remote Developers During the Coronavirus Crisis </b></h1>
<p>Believe it or not, humanity has always been facing this or that crisis. However, the main advantage of the human race is the ability to adapt to any kind of change or environment. That is why getting used to working remotely is also just a matter of time and, in fact, is the future of work.</p>
<p>Embrace such an opportunity to build strong functionality even when your employees are not under control in the office. Be there for them, be consistent, and set clear goals. Use all the abundance of online tools to do work as productive as offline, or even better as <a href="https://www.inc.com/stephen-denny/3-ways-to-inspire-innovation-from-remote-teams.html?cid=search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">working remotely</a> today may be the key to innovation tomorrow.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this rapidly changing global business and humanity environment — where cost is a true strategic differentiator — Devmind findings provide an inside look at the practices and trends currently shaping the future of enterprises.</p>
<p><b>In brief:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>COVID-19 will have global economic and financial ramifications that will be felt throughout global supply chains, from raw materials to finished products.</li>
<li>&#8220;By 2022, 80% of I&amp;O organizations that lack digital business strategies will risk cuts in budget, resulting in outsourcing as a means of delivering results,&#8221; — Gartner.</li>
<li>Considering alternate or non-traditional revenue streams might be a reliable way to follow for many vulnerable businesses, including collaborative models, dedicated teams, and remote work.</li>
</ol>
<h1>1. A challenging landscape</h1>
<p>As a typical “black swan” event, COVID-19 took the world by complete surprise. This newly identified coronavirus was first seen in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in central China, on December 31, 2019. As we almost enter April 2020, the virus has infected over 700,000 people, led to more than 30,000 deaths, and has spread to more than 200 countries.</p>
<p>The focus of most businesses is now on protecting employees, understanding the risks to their business, and managing the supply chain disruptions caused by the efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. The full impact of this epidemic on businesses is still unknown. However, one thing is certain:</p>
<blockquote><p>COVID-19 will have global economic and financial ramifications that will be felt throughout global supply chains, from raw materials to finished products.</p></blockquote>
<p>Optimizing costs is a perennial, continuous cross-enterprise effort organizations take into consideration now more than ever. <a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/globalassets/en/sales-service/documents/trends/driving-cost-optimization-whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cost optimization</a> is a critical imperative for any functional leader, but its execution and impact reach far beyond the limits of any single functional area.</p>
<p><b>Cost optimization should not be confused with budget reductions. </b>When undertaking budget reductions, functional leaders — be they marketing leads, supply chain managers, business unit directors or technology team leaders — are often asked only to hit budget reduction targets within their own departments. While a more holistic, enterprise wide approach may be beneficial, the ability of functional leaders to impact areas outside their control is often limited.</p>
<p>Organizations should approach cost optimization as an expansive effort that can have both immediate and long-term significance for business performance. To truly serve the enterprise, cost optimization demands a mix of improvements that touch every part of the enterprise.</p>
<h1>2. Under-digitized businesses are hard-hit</h1>
<p>Businesses that are currently struggling for profitability — those with low or unstable cash reserves — are particularly vulnerable.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;By 2022, 80% of I&amp;O organizations that lack digital business strategies will risk cuts in budget, resulting in outsourcing as a means of delivering results.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/infrastructure-operations-cloud-germany/featured-topics/cost-optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner Predicts</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, even businesses that appear to be in good financial shape may not be immune, depending on how the situation progresses. Sectors such as tourism, hospitality, entertainment and air transportation have been particularly hard-hit in the short term.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19345 alignnone" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business.jpg" alt="industries that suffer the most" width="1235" height="596" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business.jpg 1235w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-300x145.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-1024x494.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-768x371.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-600x290.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-450x217.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/business-1000x483.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>Businesses in consumer goods and retail may also be at higher- than-normal financial risk, especially those in seasonal businesses where demand may be lost (as opposed to shifted), such as such perishable consumer goods and seasonal apparel. Even commodity-oriented industries, such as metals and mining or oil and gas, are exposed as global demand shifts and pricing fluctuates.</p>
<h1>3. Building blocks for change: cost optimization initiatives</h1>
<p>Given the importance of managing cash flows in times like this, companies should immediately develop a <b>plan for cost optimization as part of their overall business risk and </b><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/business-continuity-efforts-in-response-to-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>continuity plans</b></a><b>.</b></p>
<p>In doing so, it is essential to take a full ecosystem perspective, as the approaches you take to manage cash will have implications for not only your business but also for your customers.</p>

<p>Borrowing from the lessons learned from the SARS outbreak in 2003, the 2008 recession and credit crunch, and the last black swan event to significantly impact global economy — the Japanese earthquake of 2011 — we see the following practices and strategies as worth considering today.</p>
<p>Among them: ensuring your own financing remains viable, focusing on the cash-to-cash conversion cycle, thinking like a CFO, revisiting your variable costs and capital investment plans, extending payables, etc.</p>
<blockquote><p>Considering alternate or non-traditional revenue streams might be a reliable way to follow for many vulnerable businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Shared services, business process outsourcing, </b><a href="https://emtemp.gcom.cloud/ngw/eventassets/en/conferences/dci9/documents/gartner-infrastructure-operations-cloud-india-cost-optimization-roadmap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>automation of IT operations</b></a> — all these components offer considerable cost saving opportunities. Enterprise cost optimization priorities — to preserve revenue, continue to innovate and keep the best staff — often conflict with the cost reduction priorities of functional leaders, which are to reduce costs quickly with as little disruption as possible.</p>
<h1>4. Five areas of focus for the enterprise</h1>
<p>While there is a great amount of functional variability in how leaders approach cost optimization, five areas of focus allow leaders in various roles and business units to pursue beneficial optimization (see the figure mentioned below).</p>
<h2>1) Benchmark to get a baseline</h2>
<p>The use of comparative metrics is a key aspect of any effective cost optimization campaign. <b>Benchmarks help leaders analyze their environments to discover what resources and initiatives may require additional funding or optimization.</b></p>
<p>Benchmarks also showcase areas of strategic investment. But care is required, as benchmarks can easily be misused.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19347 alignnone" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise.jpg" alt="cost optimization across enterprise" width="1235" height="957" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise.jpg 1235w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-300x232.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-1024x793.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-768x595.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-600x465.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-450x349.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Driving-Cost-Optimization-Across-the-Enterprise-1000x775.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<h2>2) Identify critical points in the budget to shield</h2>
<p>To bring more clarity to the optimization decision-making process, companies should identify:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">the potential financial benefit;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">business impact;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">business risk;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">time requirement of candidate cost optimization projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of impact, the effectiveness of the <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Images/infographics/services/gx-deloitte-global-cost-management-infographic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cost optimization initiative</a> is partly contingent on whether business unit leaders and their staff are capable of changing and adapting to new approaches and processes.</p>
<p>For example, optimization may involve frontline systems and tool automation as part of their business processes. What does this adaptation mean when leaders consider implementation and training timeframes?</p>
<p>To gain CEO or CFO approval for an initiative, leaders can describe a business case showing how the <b>cost optimization initiative will improve such criteria as:</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Business processes.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Productivity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Time-to-market.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The like, as opposed to continuing with the status quo.</li>
</ol>
<p>These criteria points offer a suitable framework for prioritizing which line items are worth preserving, and which projects are worth supporting.</p>
<h2>3) Identify noncritical points to eliminate</h2>
<p>Just as crucial to the decision-making process is the identification of aspects of the business that can be eliminated or reduced. These changes will be primarily quantifiable as reductions in expense, but, again, leaders should consider the significance of each point to the business. An enterprise&#8217;s position within the growth model — growing, mature or declining — serves as an initial driver for identifying and prioritizing cost optimization opportunities:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Growing companies have a higher tendency to <b>standardize and simplify IT- enabled capabilities in order to optimize costs</b> and meet business goals for matching service levels to customer demand.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Mature enterprises typically respond to cost optimization goals with investment-based programs. </b>These programs aim to automate or utilize capabilities at lower capacity costs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4) Determine cost optimization approach</h2>
<p>Several options exist for optimization, including reduction of costs, reduction of demand, and a balance of short- and long-term initiatives.</p>
<p>Some categories of optimization functions include:</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Instituting emergency cost reductions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Applying selective cost reductions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Preserving costs and business value.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increasing costs for added business value.</li>
</ol>
<h2>5) Communicate plans to stakeholders and lead the organization through the change</h2>
<p>The leader of a cost optimization program will be in constant contact with all business areas. Communication of best practices should always include details of the practice and expected outcomes.</p>
<p>Leaders can also offer a list of alternative options that were considered, along with detailed explanations outlining why the alternative options were not selected.</p>
<h1>5. Accelerating through cost-efficient remote work</h1>
<p>A virtual remote workforce enables organizations to:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Reduce costs.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Drive growth and better serve customers.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Increase business productivity.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Attract top talent.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only remote work enables organizations to shift labor costs to lower cost resources, cut travel and expense budgets, and reduce fixed facility costs, but also a virtual workforce gives organizations a greater degree of flexibility to take advantage of lower cost labor regardless of location — and engage workers only when and where the business needs. For example, many workers sourced from outlying areas and offshore locations, such as Lusaka have significantly lower wages than similarly qualified resources.</p>
<p>From Google to Ford, companies around the globe are telling staff to work from home in a bid to stem the spread of pandemic. Such remote working at scale is unprecedented and will leave a lasting impression on the way people live and work for many years to come. What companies need in uncertain times is a collaborative mindset and the ability to map and analyze the value created deep within employee networks.</p>
<h1>6. Collaborative models and dedicated teams value</h1>
<p>Although collaboration is one of the most crucial components of modern businesses, most companies still do not know how to get the most out of it. Here are some of the <b>collaborative models tactics we apply here, at Devmind:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The team members from different time zones are not assigned for one micro task.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Stories are organized between each other to ensure “rolling style” execution.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">All developers work shifted hours to ensure the best possible communications.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Work time designed so that all teams have 2 hours of overlap with regular PST work time.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Overlaps are used for daily scrums, any meetings and informal collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19346" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration.jpg" alt="distributed teams" width="1235" height="833" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration.jpg 1235w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-300x202.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-1024x691.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-768x518.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-600x405.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-450x304.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/collaboration-1000x674.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px" /></p>
<p>What companies need in a collaborative age is the ability to map and analyze the value created within employee networks. These networks should focus on both — individual and organizational effectiveness and on the value the interactions between employees and companies are created.</p>
<p>To make these interactions more useful, executives must reorient them toward the revenue and productivity benefits that collaborative models generate, the costs such interactions impose, and opportunities to improve connectivity at the points that create the greatest economic value.</p>
<h3>Dedicated Teams As More Cost-Effective Approach for Under-Digitized Businesses</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/dedicated-development-team-reimagined-and-improved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dedicated team model</a> aims to provide a client with the right developers regardless of wherever the developers and the client are, and negotiate a mode of cooperation: nearshore (in close proximity to the client), onshore (on the client’s premises), or offshore (remotely).</p>
<p>Moreover, dedicated teams are known for their flexibility, niche skills, high scaling velocity, and high loyalty. As dedicated teams offer immense flexibility, the client has a lot of space to be efficient with their budget. The key industries that look for dedicated team approach are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/platforms/healthcare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">healthcare</a> (among them a lot of pharmaceutical companies);</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/platforms/hospitality" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travel &amp; hospitality</a>;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/platforms/ar-construction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">construction</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-19352 alignnone" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123.png" alt="dedicated teams" width="1033" height="462" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123.png 1033w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-300x134.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-1024x458.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-768x343.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-600x268.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-450x201.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/123-1000x447.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1033px) 100vw, 1033px" /></p>
<h1>7. Beyond pandemic: risks and security</h1>
<p>For some organizations, survival is the only way of implementing things today. Others are crawling through the fog of uncertainty, guessing what’s next, where should be the next turn, when things get back to normal. The question is, what will new normal look like?</p>
<p>No one can answer this question for sure now. But what we believe we can state is that the new normal is already here. The pandemic has made it harder for companies to maintain risks and so — the security and stability of their operations and even survival mode. But new tactics can help leaders to safeguard their people and organizations.</p>
<p>We, at Devmind, empower companies and their workforces with digital transformation services and approaches to help them survive during these times. Are you and your organization looking for it?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">The COVID-19 pandemic sudden outbreak has affected every industry, business, and organization. But the magnitude of the crisis has disturbed the healthcare industry the most. First and foremost, because this is a human tragedy, affecting their health and lives. It is also pushing front line healthcare workers to battle the virus not known before, draining all the possibilities and resources of this industry.</p>
<p>In brief:</p>
<ol>
<li>Considering the current situation with the global health crisis, digital technologies will drastically reshape the care delivery systems in the short and long term.</li>
<li>Although nowadays, the digital transformation in the healthcare industry is on a rather slow path in comparison with tech, financial, manufacture, and other industries. But still, we have a chance to take advantage of some of the innovations.</li>
<li>Digital healthcare solutions enable new trends in the industry. We might see the rise of the trends like mobile healthcare, IoT healthcare, VR healthcare, robotics, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>The outbreak of COVID-19 is moving quickly, and some changes we see even today. Many health systems are turning to virtual care capacities in order to somehow hold the spread of a deadly virus and survive. From now on, digital technologies will drastically reshape the care delivery systems in the short and long term.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the healthcare industry, like any other one, is influenced by digital transformation. It means that different technological tools and solutions are used to enhance the patient experience, service delivery, create new business models, and make communication more efficient. It’s not only about technology but how and for what purpose it can be implemented to help the healthcare field grow and elevate.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19367" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Healthcare-The-Changes-are-Coming-.png" alt="Digital Transformation in Healthcare The Changes are Coming" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Healthcare-The-Changes-are-Coming-.png 660w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Healthcare-The-Changes-are-Coming--300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Healthcare-The-Changes-are-Coming--600x236.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Healthcare-The-Changes-are-Coming--450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Digital transformation in healthcare is going to be an exciting step for society as it automation of the processes, better management, diagnosis, and treatment. Although, the process is slower than compared to digital transformation in banking, for instance. There is a chance to learn more from experience in other industries and even accelerate the process in healthcare based on the available results.</p>
<p>The core aim behind digital transformation is to create more customer-centered services, and it will be of great importance in healthcare as the treatment of every patient can become more personalized, thus making it better for the patients.</p>
<h2><strong>Digital Transformation In Healthcare Industry: New Era For The Society </strong></h2>
<p>Healthcare digital transformation could be a great breakthrough for the medical industry. The implementation of the right solutions will bring a lot of advantages, and some diseases could be cured more effectively and much quicker.</p>
<p>Some companies have already started to use technologies for the benefit of the healthcare industry. Here are some of the examples.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Digital Transformation In Healthcare?</strong></h2>
<p>Digital transformation in healthcare is not only about technologies but, to be more precise, it’s rather about the way to use available tools, software, technologies, etc. to get the most from it for the sake of people’s health. Like any other sphere that is influenced by digital transformation, the healthcare industry puts patients at the center. It means that all the efforts will be put into the enhancement of treatment quality, better analysis, and medicine selection to cure a particular disease.</p>
<p>The transformation has a lot of benefits for all the parties involved, as technologies allow us to work more effectively. Now medical centers and huge healthcare enterprises have to rethink their business strategies and build the way to more opportunities that come with transformation. So, what are the top benefits of digitalization in the healthcare field?</p>
<h2><strong>Digital Transformation Examples In Healthcare</strong></h2>
<p>Although nowadays, the digital transformation in the healthcare industry is on a rather slow path in comparison with tech, financial, manufacture, and other industries. But still, we have a chance to take advantage of some of the innovations. For instance, heart rate trackers that are installed on wearables (fitness trackers, smartwatches) provide important data and can prevent heart attacks, provide health recommendations to the users as they are synced with smartphone apps. One of the examples is the Apple smartwatch that sends alerts once someone experiences atrial fibrillation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19368" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry-.png" alt="Digital Healthcare Solutions that Enhance Industry" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry-.png 660w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry--300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry--600x236.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Healthcare-Solutions-that-Enhance-Industry--450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Another bright example of the use of digital technologies in medicine is a company BostonGene. The company uses biomedical software to analyze patients’ disease history to help doctors prescribe the right treatment according to the patient&#8217;s genetics to fight cancer more effectively.</p>
<p>Devices and solutions like this are going to make a great impact on the healthcare field in every country, providing more efficient treatment, better process organization, and reducing costs.</p>
<h2><strong>Top Benefits Of Digital Transformation In Healthcare</strong></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Better Services for Patients<br />
</strong>Healthcare, like any other industry that steps on the path to digital transformation, is patient(customer)-centred. The implementation of numerous technologies will give a chance to make treatment more personalized (as we can see from the examples mentioned above). The individual approach is always better than following common recommendations that might not work in some cases.</li>
<li><strong>Better Analysis<br />
</strong>The use of such technologies as AI or ML gives opportunities to analyze data effectively and much quicker than people can do. Also, these technologies minimize mistakes, thus improving staff productivity.</li>
<li><strong>Better Organization<br />
</strong>Thanks to Cloud computing and other digital tools, all the data could be digitalized. It allows quick access to medical records that give doctors a chance to make decisions effectively and provide more profound treatment. In addition to this, wearable devices could alert both patients and doctors in case of emergency in call the ambulance automatically.</li>
<li><strong>Better Time Management<br />
</strong>The implementation of different digital solutions into the healthcare field saves a lot of valuable time. This is how numerous lives could be saved when we have, for instance, a 24/7 connection with medical staff.</li>
<li><strong>Better Environment for Doctors<br />
</strong>The technologies enable access to a large amount of data; they provide better communication and could provide important information for the research. More profound research that doctors could make results in better treatment and leads us to the first benefit in our list, better services for the patients.</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Digital Healthcare: Trends, Solutions, And Technologies Used </strong></h2>
<p>Although digital transformation concentrates more on advantages for the patients and medical staff, still technologies and solutions are the tools that enable this process. What are they?</p>
<h2><strong>Digital Healthcare Solutions That Enhance Industry</strong></h2>
<p>Digital healthcare is a rather new field, but thanks to the experience of some developed countries, now we can take advantage of the following solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>make online doctor appointments;</li>
<li>create electronic medical records;</li>
<li>create unified platforms for data exchange;</li>
<li>use chatbots to provide necessary information online (while a patient is checking the website);</li>
<li>use electronic medical cards that contain all patients’ medical records and prescribed medications, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are numerous ways where software solutions can be used in healthcare in order to enhance the national medical industry. The question is when these advantages are going to be used to the full potential?</p>
<h2><strong>The Latest Digital Healthcare Trends</strong></h2>
<p>Digital healthcare solutions enable new trends in the industry. This year we might see the rise of the following trends:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mobile Healthcare</strong><br />
Use mobile apps that help you keep in touch with a doctor, make appointments, or contact medical centers much quicker, etc.;</li>
<li><strong>IoT Healthcare</strong><br />
Use wearable devices to record data about your health in real-time thus helping doctors to understand the full image of your condition, etc.;</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19369" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/VR-Healthcare-.png" alt="VR Healthcare" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/VR-Healthcare-.png 660w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/VR-Healthcare--300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/VR-Healthcare--600x236.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/VR-Healthcare--450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>VR Healthcare</strong><br />
Virtual Reality appointments with a doctor are useful when a patient cannot get to the facility. Also, the use of VR consultations could save a lot of time as patients could immediately contact doctors and describe their symptoms, and by the time they get to the hospital, the doctor would come up with the treatment or prepare everything that is required to take care of the patient effectively and quickly. Apart from this, VR could be used for training medical staff and enhance their skills.</li>
<li><strong>Robotics</strong><br />
The use of robots in healthcare can bring a lot of advantages. For instance, they could assist physicians in examining patients, ship medical supplies, assist with rehabilitation, provide help with medical supplies packing. Also, it could be used for the automation of some processes.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the most common and popular trends nowadays, but we might see new ones as technologies are constantly changing. So, what are the technologies that enable all these trends and solutions in the modern world?</p>
<h2><strong>Digital Healthcare Technology </strong></h2>
<p>So, today digital healthcare technology promotes numerous changes in society and in the healthcare field in particular. These are the most popular technologies that are used to enhance the medical facilities and the industry in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>Artificial Intelligence (has a great potential for data analysis thus providing better diagnosis);</li>
<li>Augmented Reality (helps with the enhancement of efficiency and cost optimization of surgeries);</li>
<li>Cloud Computing (enables storage and sharing of data across platforms);</li>
<li>Blockchain technology (provides a chance for other doctors to see a patient’s medical history and continue the treatment);</li>
<li>IoT (wearable devices and supporting apps collect real-time data that could help doctors to have the full image of the patient’s state; these data could also be analyzed and provide useful insights for numerous researches).</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Healthcare Industry: What’s Next? </strong></h2>
<p>The eHealthcare field is only taking the first steps into the direction of digital transformation. Some countries outrace others, but still, we cannot call this phenomenon a global one. But thanks to the available digital healthcare technology that is constantly enhancing and upgrading, we might see a new image of healthcare in the upcoming years, more efficient and almost flawless.</p>
<p>Companies and medical facilities should think of the right strategy to use available software solutions to make this world a better place. <strong><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/contacts">Talk to our experts</a> and find out more about the topic and how your business or project can start benefiting from it today!</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">The novel 2020 pandemic takes every sphere of human activity into the next level. Financial institutions are forced to move quickly to protect their employees, transform their operations, and serve customers in new, improved ways.</p>
<p>In brief:</p>
<ol>
<li>The software revolution — which has already disrupted many industries and has made some industries essentially obsolete — is still rapidly transforming the financial services industry.</li>
<li>Digital transformation banking strategy should include relevant technologies that can bring the most value for both the bank and its customers.</li>
<li>The future of digital banking transformation is impressive, and it is predicted to entirely change the image of traditional banks, as well as bring more services to the customers.</li>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19371" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png" alt="The Future Of Digital Transformation in Banking" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png 660w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-600x236.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-Future-Of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>As the coronavirus continues to spread around the world, more and more organizations will miss their financial targets because of strategic and operational disruptions and dampened customer demand. It’s also unclear how long COVID-19 will last. But one sure thing is here — this will not be a short-term event with fewer consequences. Industries, such as banking, should prepare for the long haul.</p>
<p>However, the software revolution — which has already disrupted many industries and has made some industries essentially obsolete — is still rapidly transforming the financial services industry. Digital transformation in banking has already started, and now we can see some changes like 24/7 online banking and instant transactions.</p>
<p>Still, the process in this sphere is quite slow. To begin a journey to digital transformation, institutions have to develop a detailed strategy to change their distribution model, revise and enhance value offers, as well as develop end-to-end customer-centered processes that can result in growth and customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>There are a number of technologies available nowadays that can help in the process of the digital transformation of the banking field. Good digital transformation banking strategy should include relevant technologies that can bring the most value for both the bank and its customers. Among the trending technology solutions, we can distinguish:</p>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></p>
<p>AI in banking is represented by chatbots or online assistants that help customers with their issues by providing necessary information or executing different transactions. Apart from this, AI can be used for the purpose of data analysis and security. For instance, identify money laundering by analyzing customer data within several seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Blockchain</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of blockchain in banking can result in a better interface, more accuracy, and secured data and transactions. In addition, blockchain solutions will make transactions and different operations transparent, facilitating collaboration. There will be no need for the intermediation of the third parties, thus bringing up the level of trust from the customers. It can also influence cloud technologies and move to decentralized ones, which will result in higher protection of the data and funds.</p>
<p><strong>Internet Of Things</strong></p>
<p>IoT is helpful with real-time data analysis, thus makes the customer experience more personal, and banks are able to provide individually-tailored offers. What is more, thanks to wearables, customers can easily and seamlessly make contactless payments. Apart from this, IoT is helpful with risk management and access to platforms; the authentication process can be supported by biometric sensors that make access more secure and protected.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud Computing</strong></p>
<p>Cloud computing is another technology that can help banks become more efficient and gives them a chance to provide more innovations, as well as have better productivity, improve operations, and instantaneously deliver products and services. Cloud computing, as well as IoT, can help with risk management and create a secure environment for the customers and internal bank systems.</p>
<p>All in all, the digital transformation of the banking field will bring great innovations that will change the image of banks we know nowadays. Technologies bring numerous opportunities both for banks and their customers by securing personal data, increasing transparency, and giving a chance to manage funds anytime and anywhere.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation In Investment Banking</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19372" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking.png" alt="Digital Transformation in Investment Banking" width="660" height="310" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking.png 660w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking-300x141.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking-600x282.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Investment-Banking-450x211.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Despite all the benefits brought by digital transformation in banking, investment banking is going to face some challenges in the current environment. Investment banking doesn’t take deposits and functions as a facilitator between buyers and sellers and keeps data protected.</p>
<p>As we have already discussed, the rise of digital solutions in banking can result in increased data transparency, elimination of intermediates in the process, and alternative methods to access financial and intellectual data. All this can result in lower pricing on the operations and make transactions easier and faster. Investment banks can be replaced by a group of small investors brought together at one digital platform. The occurrence of new players in the niche (for instance, fintech companies), eliminating entry barriers, and disintermediation can put investment banks in dire straits.</p>
<p>Still, it’s not all doomed, as there always will be a need for professional advice on complex operations and big deals. In order to survive in this competing world, the investment banks should think of the ways to use available data and skills in the digitalized world.</p>
<h2>Digital Transformation In Retail Banking</h2>
<p>Retail banks have more opportunities in comparison with investment banks, but still, the journey to digital transformation is rather long and requires a lot of resources. First of all, in order to succeed, their strategy should be customer-centered. Banks possess a lot of important data that can be used as a background for new innovative solutions and services that can satisfy customers to the full.</p>
<p>Technologies like blockchain and AI (Artificial Intelligence) can be of great advantage if the bank wants to survive competition with fintech companies, online banks, and non-financial platforms that provide exact services to their customers and have more advantages over traditional banks. These tools can automate numerous manual operations, thus enhance customer satisfaction. Also, AI and IoT can be used together to collect and analyze personal data of the customers for the banks to create more personalized offers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19373" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking.png" alt="Digital Transformation in Retail Banking" width="660" height="260" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking.png 660w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-300x118.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-600x236.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Digital-Transformation-in-Retail-Banking-450x177.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for retail banks in this situation can be to find a professional team or create an inner IT department. But thanks to the available platforms and outsource companies, this issue can be easily overcome.</p>
<h2>Advantages And Disadvantages Of Digital Transformation In Banking</h2>
<p>Digital transformation of the banking institutions brings a lot of new opportunities for the customers, individual ones, small companies, and huge corporations, as well as banks themselves. Clever strategy and constant improvements can result in a number of advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Convenience<br />
</strong>Personal and company bank accounts are available at any device, the only things you need are an Internet connection and a few taps on the screen. This brings more customer satisfaction as they are able to constantly keep on track of their account balance and manage the information on their personal profile (add new mailing address, e-mails, telephone numbers, etc.). In addition to this, there is no need to go to the bank to get checks as they can be instantly sent to your email address.</li>
<li><strong>24/7 Service<br />
</strong>Online banking services are available 24/7 all year round, even at the weekends. There is no need to stay in lines and wait for the bank to open in order to conduct certain operations. It’s a huge advantage that comes with digital solutions.</li>
<li><strong>Time-Saving<br />
</strong>Another advantage, you save a lot of time as you have access to the account from home. It is extremely convenient as previously you could waste an hour or two at the bank to make simple operations, and now it is done seamlessly from home or any other place where there is an Internet connection.</li>
<li><strong>Automated Transfers<br />
</strong>Direct banks can provide unlimited automated transfers (accept payroll deposits or provide automatic bill payment) with no additional fees for the services even to outside financial institutions.</li>
<li><strong>Easier Management<br />
</strong>Online accounts can be easily managed, although they require more information than traditional banks. Customers can add information themselves or directly contact online assistants to provide support on the current issue. What is more, payee information is retained within the system, there is no need to re-enter data for the following payments, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19374" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png" alt="Advantages and Disadvantages of Digital Transformation in Banking" width="660" height="340" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking.png 660w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-300x155.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-600x309.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Advantages-and-Disadvantages-of-Digital-Transformation-in-Banking-450x232.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></p>
<p>Although the advantages are impressive, and they facilitate the work to a great extent, there are still some disadvantages that follow the process. Here are the main ones:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Issues<br />
</strong>Cybersecurity is one of the most important issues that companies and institutions are struggling to overcome. Even sophisticated software that protects tentative data cannot completely protect accounts from scammers, phishing, hacker attacks, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Services<br />
</strong>Nowadays, not all banks can offer a wide range of online services. Still, there are some that require your presence at the traditional banks.</li>
<li><strong>Transactions<br />
</strong>Complex transactions may also require the presence at the bank office. Also, international transactions are not possible with all digital banks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number of disadvantages is rather low, and it’s only a matter of time for them to disappear. Advantages take over disadvantages and make daily operations much easier, reduce costs, save customer’s time, and manage to provide services efficiently.</p>
<h2>Challenges Of Digital Transformation In Banking</h2>
<p>The future of digital banking transformation is impressive, and it is predicted to entirely change the image of traditional banks, as well as bring more services to the customers. But today banks face certain challenges that are difficult to overcome:</p>
<h3>Competition With Non-Financial Institutions</h3>
<p>Amazon is trying to provide banking opportunities to its customers. Facebook allows users to make transfers directly to other people’s bank accounts, thus leaving banks out of the process. But banks are more regulated institutions, thus more secure. It is important for them to go digital quicker.</p>
<h3>Online Payments</h3>
<p>Not every bank can support online/mobile or contactless payments. The reason for this is that a bank cannot provide another option but physical payment as it doesn’t have a secure online platform, resources, and skilled team to make it possible. It gets even harder to compete with available online services like ApplePay and PayPal.</p>
<h3>Technologies</h3>
<p>The system that provides online banking services should be constantly updated and have an efficient security level. Cybersecurity is one of the most important issues nowadays that banks should take into consideration first of all. Again, in order to overcome this challenge, the bank has to set up a detailed strategy, choose appropriate technologies and find a professional team that can easily turn ideas into reality with the latest software and available tools.</p>
<p>The process of digital transformation is rather endless as technologies enhance, the systems should be constantly updated. New technologies will give a chance for new services to appear that again will require constant upgrade and support.</p>
<p>Digital transformation in banking is going to speed up in the upcoming years. Financial institutions should take into account the current state of affairs, work out a profound strategy, and use the right tools in order to succeed in the future.</p>
<p>The transformation journey is not an easy thing and involves a lot of resources, but as a result, the services could be more secured and delivered quicker, and most of all, enhance the level of customer satisfaction. As technologies develop and enhance, the banking industry will also get better and better year by year.</p>
