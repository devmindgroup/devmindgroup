										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how many innovative products have seen the light of our tech-filled days, one thing remains unchanged — in the B2C universe, consumers reach for simple yet mesmerizing innovation with a sky-high “cool and trendy” factor, with useful and simple being almost as important. This is the type of product Adero has built for its customers and earned it a top spot in the much-coveted Fast Company rating.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.adero.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adero</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, formerly TrackR, whose shareholders include Amazon, Foundry and Revolution, developed a series of products and software solutions along with Activefield, a platform that can scale across many products, many companies and unlimited use cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adero, being a well-funded startup, has been successfully reinventing itself to stay relevant as it grows together with its addressable market. Like any early stage ventures, one of Adero’s challenges hinged on a need to scale its software development together with its engineering bandwidth, with the required growth vs. available local resources.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Competing in a rather fragmented market of IoT-based consumer solutions for organizations, Adero aimed high, worked hard, and raced against time to go to market with an offering that would win over millennial and Generation X consumers alike.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During its quest, Adero partnered with Devmind, which was able to integrate its efforts smoothly into the strides undertaken by Adero’s in-house team. Understanding  IoT technologies, the intricacies of hardware design and embedded software, coupled with an innate understanding of the needs and wants of Adero’s core consumers, Devmind was able to contribute its skills and knowledge to the partnership, resulting in a product that lies at the core of the intelligent, easy and stress-free organization concept of Adero. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shortly after the product’s release, Fast Company awarded Adero the #10 spot on their list of Most Innovative Companies, alongside tech giants Apple, Google and Microsoft.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">About Adero &amp; Smart Tagging System</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adero (formerly known as TrackR) is a Santa Barbara, CA-based technology company that provides an intelligent organization system aiming to end the stress and chaos that comes with managing personal things. Converging consumer electronics, hardware, the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile, software, and wireless in one place, Adero’s </span><b>Smart Tagging</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system lets a user’s life essentials manage and keep track of themselves.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16580" src="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adero-3.jpg" alt="Adero" width="625" height="476" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adero-3.jpg 817w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adero-3-300x228.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adero-3-768x585.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adero-3-600x457.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Adero-3-450x343.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>1 Smart Tag (parent beacon) and 3 Taglets (smaller beacons) connected to it</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No matter how many things you have and the number of bags you use to carry them, Adero is built to ensure you never lose anything in a simple way. The logic behind Adero’s product is the following. The Smart Tagging system consists of small tracking devices, parent trackers, and a custom mobile app. You place the parent beacon (called a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Smart Tag</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) on a bag, the smaller trackers (called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taglets</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">) on the things you usually put in that bag, and then register the bag and its tags in the mobile app. When you leave something from the bag behind, the app sends you a notification after communicating with trackers. You can organise the bags, trackers, and notifications in the app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How hard was the road to the seamlessly working final product and the customer? And where did Devmind step in to play the part?</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Challenges, Challenges, Challenges</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the start, Adero faced fierce competition in the tracking solutions market. The only option was creating a pitch-perfect product that would fully deliver on the premise of keeping track of personal belongings at all times. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The final result needed to be simple, work seamlessly, and stand out among competitors. Adero’s talented team had experience  creating similar products that enjoyed success, including the wireless speaker system from Sonos, XBox from Microsoft and the Tesla.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16581" src="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-4.32.09-PM.png" alt="Adero" width="501" height="602" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-4.32.09-PM.png 571w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-4.32.09-PM-250x300.png 250w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screen-Shot-2019-04-24-at-4.32.09-PM-375x450.png 375w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>The accompanying mobile app is an important part of Adero&#8217;s product</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Adero began working with various development partners focusing on design, firmware, hardware, and software. The two unresolved pieces of the fully-developed product puzzle were: a) ensuring interoperability between all product components and b) simplicity of the solution that would resonate with users of diverse tastes, age groups and abilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those tasks Adero selected Devmind to partner across mobile, cloud, and microservices development. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building the Team &amp; Getting to Work</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the right expertise and niche skills were critical to the product development success, contracting planned time to market put both companies under significant pressure to perform fast and, most importantly, to deliver robust and superb performance. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Devmind such a time-pressed environment is actually a modus operandi, as many domestic and foreign enterprise clients come to Devmind “in a pinch.” The company has a well-oiled system of acquiring, training and onboarding the resources with required core domain and technology prowess and compiling an outstanding team within Adero-required deadline.  Devmind has been working with Adero through a combination model from its offshore development centers in Kyiv and Ibex Hill, as well as on-site in a client-facing capacity at Adero’s offices in Santa Barbara. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The project epitomised success of this close collaboration between Devmind and Adero teams that enjoyed great synergies in the process, consisting of knowledge sharing across a wide array of subjects from general technology challenges to particular relevant  intricacies in software development. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Areas of Collaboration: </span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iOS app MVP architecture (Swift)</span></li>

<p><iframe title="Adero | The Intelligent Organization System" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oD_daUCItt8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abundant Payoff Was Commensurate With The Efforts</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intelectsoft’s cooperation with Adero could not have resulted into anything short of an award- winning product that stands out among competition. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fast Company ranked Adero #10</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">in their list of Most Innovative Companies of 2019 in the Consumer Electronics segment. Adero stands beside the majority of the tech industry’s giants, including Apple, Google, and IBM. Meanwhile, the customers enjoy Adero’s simple and elegant product that helps manage essentials without leaving behind vital items for all upcoming engagements in an easy and sleek manner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Smart devices were supposed to make our lives better.  However, over the past year we’ve discovered that users are quickly becoming overwhelmed in this overly-connected blue-chip stuffed IoT driven world,” said Adero’s Chief Executive Officer Nate Kelly. “More apps to manage, more devices to keep an eye on, more cords to untangle and remember about—it’s way too much! Adero is giving the users  an opportunity to passively manage and keep track of their essentials in a non-invasive way that allows for confidence and a peace of mind for our customers. ur system of tags, effectively “taking care” of the items,” freeing consumers’ minds to focus on more rewarding matters. Without Devmind’s expertise, getting a product of this quality to market, especially within the outlined time constraints, would have been nearly impossible.”</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On April 23, Devmind’s top experts of the Construction Industry went live for a 40-minute webinar to discuss how construction leaders should act now to think one step ahead of the current crisis.</p>
<p>Our experts weigh in on the latest research and trends to help to imagine the perfect digitization phases for one building development and more effective, affordable, and efficient solutions.</p>
<p>The “Digital Transformation in Construction. Thinking One Step Ahead” tackled the areas of implementation, real-life examples, constraints, and more regarding the potential digital transformation steps as different layers or dimensions of the BIM repository and other essential tools.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a65aj-SD0FA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>Watch The Video:</b></a></h2>
<p><iframe title="Webinar: Digital Transformation in Construction" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a65aj-SD0FA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<h2>Digitalization as XD Roadmap</h2>
<p>Digital transformation in the construction industry is not just a nice to have thing from a design, estimating, and safety perspective. It is also becoming a part of state regulations in most developed countries.</p>
<p>During the webinar, we considered the adoption of 3D and CAD modeling as the base-level and reviewed all other D’s to 8D as a new layer or dimension added new Interactions between parties, collaboration opportunities, and other benefits.</p>
<p>Talking about the ecosystem, there were five parties of system interactions: customers who would be a project owner, a cost control department, management including Project and Operations managers, third-party vendors and contractors, and engineers and developers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19912" src="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53.jpg" alt="webinar roadmap " width="1563" height="1177" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53.jpg 1563w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-300x226.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-1024x771.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-768x578.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-1536x1157.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-600x452.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-450x339.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2020-04-27-at-16.25.53-1000x753.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1563px) 100vw, 1563px" /></p>
<p>In the 3D case, our base level, we assumed that all designing and engineering work is done in 3D. So all initial project documentation right from the start is digital. We have Architects and Engineers collaborating and sharing on the system. The 4th dimension or 4D case would be time.</p>
<p>In the particular version the BIM repository adds:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Planning and Estimation;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Integration with construction management tools;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Documents, Materials, and Phases approvals workflows;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Deep integration with Design and construction simulation tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the 5th dimension, we would add costs. In the 6th layer, we add even more parties and control to the system. The 7th dimension is all about post-production management, operations, and reconstruction. And finally, the last 8th dimension is safety during the project and after it is completed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a class="btn" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a65aj-SD0FA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch Webinar</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: left;">With <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/global/Documents/Energy-and-Resources/gx-eri-GPoC-executive-summary-2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$428,622 million</a> of market capitalization, the global construction industry remains one of the <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/capital-projects-and-infrastructure/our-insights/imagining-constructions-digital-future" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">world’s</a> under-digitized sectors. Yet, we see an increasing number of construction companies aim to transform business processes <a href="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/advanced-imaging-algorithms-for-digital-twin-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">digitally</a>. One of the national construction leaders dared to become an industry pioneer by getting a digital transformation of their ERP with three spot-on solutions. And this is what comes of it.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The customer needed a single software solution that would streamline construction project management across all departments, elevate the partner management processes, and simplify truck and asset management.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We created an all-in-one ERP with three interconnected solutions. First, a portal for project management with time-tracking option. Second, a geofencing system for onsite presence visibility. And third, a mobile solution for truck drivers that simplifies asset delivery and management.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Now, everyone, from a truck driver to an on-site inspector, is empowered with a useful tool to carry out their tasks quickly and efficiently.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Challenge: Lots of Data, No Infrastructure</h2>
<p>One of the nation’s top construction companies decided to move away from unsynced legacy systems and enable innovation. They approached us for a digital transformation of their key operations as part of the company’s business development plan.</p>
<p><b>The company needed a single software platform that would:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">streamline construction project management across all departments,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">elevate the partner management processes,</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">and simplify construction equipment  and assets management.</li>
</ul>
<p>We faced a simple, yet complex challenge: to streamline crucial processes in assets, partners, and project management. There were no quick and easy answers. And more questions amounted.</p>
<p>The complexity of the company’s projects increased the complexity of the challenge. And the success of any company&#8217;s project relies on an immense number of elements and involves many partners and parties, including governmental institutions.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The company’s civil engineering building and infrastructure construction projects start in the middle of nowhere — there was no infrastructure at all. </i></p></blockquote>
<p>At the same time, there were a zillion things to manage: from resources, people, and documentation, including certificates and passes to the site, to numerous inventory items and machinery, the materials that arrive and leave the site.</p>
<p>Therefore, the solution needed to unlock the next stage of the construction giant’s growth and tackle significant business challenges connected to the company’s key operations, as well as across-the-board project organization. In the end, the company became the first local construction company to embrace innovation on such a large scale.</p>
<h2>The Solution: All-in-one Construction ERP</h2>
<p>Together with the Innovation team, we launched a series of software workshops. After shaping the overarching solution and problematic areas, the group proceeded to the development stage.</p>
<p>The result was an enterprise ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) tuned and customized for construction projects consisting of <b>three streamlined and interconnected solutions:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">a portal for construction project management with time-tracking solutions;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">an on-site geofencing system;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">a mobile solution for truck drivers that simplifies asset delivery and management as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18589" src="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-1-scaled.jpg" alt="Reshaping Construction Industry: A Story of Digital Transformation" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-1-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-1-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-1-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-1-600x401.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-1-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-1-1000x668.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<p>Moreover, some of the solutions are unique to the construction industry — no one implemented such technology before the construction giant’s partnership with Devmind.</p>
<h3>Portal for Project Management</h3>
<p>The resources management portal is the starting point and the foundation of the complex solution. Before its implementation, the company relied on Excel, and the process of exchanging and managing crucial project information was segmented.</p>
<blockquote><p>To address the issue, we created a custom, cloud-based construction resources  management portal that converges critical aspects of a project in a single digital environment that is easy to maneuver.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Key features include:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Management of large-scale construction projects;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Management of Users (workers), Teams (Groups), Vendors (Subcontractors);</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Materials management (loading and unloading of raw materials for trucks);</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Management of machines — trucks, lorries, excavators, bulldozers, etc.;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Geofencing — automated work shift check-in and checkout for onsite presence visibility;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Vendor ecosystem;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Time-tracking solution;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Integration with Internal and Government services for data and requirements (e.g., mandatory worker card).</li>
</ul>
<p>The design and functionality of this solution ensures transparency and communication between the company&#8217;s employees and departments, as well as other involved parties. The portal also makes it easy to monitor the progress of the company’s and its partners’ employees, as well as improves partner collaboration with easy third-party integration.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18590" src="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-2.jpg" alt="Reshaping Construction Industry: A Story of Digital Transformation" width="1500" height="996" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-2.jpg 1500w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-2-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-2-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-2-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-2-600x398.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-2-450x299.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-2-1000x664.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>Now, the company can carefully manage every aspect of any project, elevating project efficiency to new heights.</p>
<h3>On-site Geofencing</h3>
<p>As other large construction companies, our customer partners with a lot of organizations/vendors across all of its divisions, and the workers of these organizations are present on project sites.</p>
<p><b>The process of organizing this cooperation involved several issues: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Representatives needed to carry their ID cards on their work clothes;</li>
<li>On-site reporting with paper documents proved uncomfortable to employees and their partners alike;</li>
<li>The problems affected the level of project security and efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<p>To address the issues, we established an advanced <b>geofencing system for onsite presence visibility.</b></p>
<blockquote><p>It was the first solution of its kind for the local construction industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Already tested on a road construction project, the system became a reliable backbone for on-site ID card check-in/check-out, allowing the company to see which employee entered the site and which partner company or organization they represent.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-18593" src="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-5.jpg" alt="Reshaping Construction Industry: A Story of Digital Transformation" width="1500" height="996" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-5.jpg 1500w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-5-300x199.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-5-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-5-768x510.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-5-600x398.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-5-450x299.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/screen-5-1000x664.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" /></p>
<p>We’ve also created <b>a separate functionality for inspectors</b> working on the projects, completely transferring their workflow to mobile and removing paperwork from the process.</p>
<p>The geofencing solution and inspector solution are directly connected to the labor management portal, converging everything in one place.</p>
<h3>A Mobile Solution for Truck Drivers</h3>
<p>The legacy solution was too complicated and uncomfortable for the drivers. At the same time, the premise of the process was rather simple: a truck arrives at a site, unloads (or loads) the materials, records the type and amount of materials, and leaves the site. Also, it was a stand-alone solution that was not synced with any other software system of the company.</p>
<blockquote><p>To solve the problem, we created a mobile-driven solution that simplifies the process as much as possible, bringing in other substantial benefits along the way. It is also connected to the labor management portal.</p></blockquote>
<p><b>How it works:</b></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">A driver records the process of unloading and loading with one click;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Selects which material they delivered or loaded for delivery, and how much of it;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Leaves the project site.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Some benefits for the construction company:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">No reporting: the app collects the data, and is accessible on a dedicated dashboard;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Integration with other systems;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Improved weight control;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Geofencing: the app records when a truck arrives and leaves.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Continuous Impact and Collaboration</h2>
<p>From a truck driver to an on-site inspector and anyone that partners with the construction giant on a project, now everyone is empowered with an effective tool to carry out their tasks quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>This collaboration formed an <b>impactful and unique solution that puts the customer several steps ahead of the competition</b>, confirming the company’s reputation as a leader and innovator in the construction industry.</p>
<p>Seeing that solution has proven to solve the customer’s challenges is the greatest reward for us. We hope to witness more and more construction companies to implement innovations and disrupt digital transformation in the future. And Devmind is here to have their backs!</p>
<p>The construction giant’s partnership with Devmind continues in other areas that modern technology could transform and improve further. It also carried the customer over to the next business development stage, ensuring the company’s end-to-end digital transformation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Lusaka District, Zambia, March 21, 2019 </strong> – Devmind, a boutique digital transformation consultancy that provides cutting-edge engineering solutions for global companies and emerging technology leaders, today announced that its solutions helped Adero earn a place on Fast Company’s list of <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/most-innovative-companies/2019/sectors/consumer-electronics" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)">“Most Innovative Companies 2019.”</a> Adero has taken the top 10 spot in the Consumer Electronics category alongside Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Dell.</p>



<p>For more than  a year now Devmind has been a trusted development partner for Adero&#8217;s first product, the intelligent organization system. Positioned at the intersection of consumer electronics, hardware, the internet of things (IoT), mobile, software, and wireless, Adero offers customers a simple but smart solution for organizing belongings of different sizes. The system consists of small tracking devices, parent trackers, and a custom mobile app. Users place the parent beacon (called a Smart Tag) on a bag, the smaller trackers (called Taglets) on the belongings they usually put in that bag, and then register the bag and its tags in the mobile app. When a user leaves something from the bag behind, the app sends a notification after communicating with trackers. The bags, trackers, and notifications can be organized by the user in the app.</p>



<p>A solution to the ever-present problem of the busy modern lifestyle, Adero’s product was challenging to bring to life successfully. Adero got in touch with Devmind to tap into the company’s wide-ranging expertise in Mobile, IoT, and Cloud and make their innovative idea a reality. Closely working with the Adero team on- and off-site in Santa Barbara, CA, Devmind brought its extensive expertise and technical standards in iOS and Android apps MVP architecture, AWS, and microservices management. Devmind’s IoT engineers have created a mobile solution and established fail-safe communication between the app, the parent trackers, and the smaller tracking devices, ensuring a successful release of Adero’s product to the public. Shortly after launching, Adero made it to Fast Company’s list of the world’s leading innovation companies.</p>



<p>Michael Minkevich, CEO of Devmind, commented: “Innovative products and devices excite us and make our lives easier and better. Under the hood, truly innovative solutions also demand a lot of hard work, serious technical skills, dedication, creativity and much more — not only to bring to life, but also to consistently and successfully deliver on their promise. As Adero’s premier engineering partner, we are honored to have had the opportunity to bring all these necessary skills to the company’s product and help Adero receive such high praise from both the top tech media and the consumers. Devmind is always focused on helping emerging leaders like Adero get a solid foothold in the competitive tech world by making their innovative efforts materialise, tick all the necessary boxes, and exceed expectations.”</p>



<p>“Smart devices were supposed to make our lives better but we’ve discovered over the past year that connecting anything and everything possible to the Internet is adding to our burden instead of alleviating it,” said Adero’s Chief Executive Officer Nate Kelly. “More apps to manage, more devices to keep an eye on, more cords to untangle—it’s too much. Adero is giving your essentials awareness and intelligence to keep track of themselves so you don’t have to. We’re transferring the anxiety from you to our system of tags, effectively telling them to “take care of this bag” and “take care of the essentials in this bag,” freeing your mind to focus on what matters most. Without Devmind’s expertise, getting this product to market would have been nearly impossible.”</p>



<p><strong>About Adero </strong></p>



<p>Adero (formerly known as TrackR) is a Santa Barbara, CA-based technology company that provides an intelligent organization system aiming to end the stress and chaos that comes with managing your things. Powered by Bluetooth technology, and made easy with an intuitive app, Adero’s Smart Tagging system enables your life’s essentials to manage and keep track of themselves.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From </span><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/cases/SCIENTISTMASTERS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SCIENTISTMASTERS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the UK’s National Health Services, Devmind has provided impactful software solutions to the world’s established brands and organizations through the Three years of operation. Our software solves problems in many industries and areas of focus: we have built a streamlined mobile publishing platform to help </span><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/cases/ernst-young" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SCIENTISTMASTERS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a campus app for the training center of a top oil and gas company</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a marketing iPad app for </span><a href="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/cases/harley-davidson"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Harley-Davidson</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sports and events have also been one of our focuses, as we helped hockey team likes San Diego Gulls and Grand Rapids Griffins elevate their stadium and game experience. As a result, we have reached another important milestone: the legendary </span><a href="https://www.visitoslo.com/en/whats-on/holmenkollen-ski-festival/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Holmenkollen Ski Festival</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> turned to Devmind for an official event app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year for over a century, people from Ibex Hill and the country’s guests gather at Oslo’s highest point — the neighbourhood of Holmenkollen. The area has one of the greatest ski jump hills in the world and has proven to be a fitting place for holding ski competitions since 1892. This year, ski enthusiasts will gather at the festival once again to enjoy ski jumping, cross-country skiing on various distances, and biathlon. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To provide a comfortable event experience for the Digital Age, the festival turned to Devmind for an essential event app. The app was created with Devmind low-code mobile app platform Mobile Roadie, which now has pre-made modules to allow for faster delivery of apps without loss in quality. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4741" src="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Welcome-1-576x1024.jpg" alt="Holmenkollen Ski Fest App" width="409" height="727" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Welcome-1-576x1024.jpg 576w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Welcome-1-169x300.jpg 169w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Welcome-1-768x1365.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Welcome-1-600x1067.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Welcome-1-253x450.jpg 253w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Welcome-1-563x1000.jpg 563w, https://www.devmindgroup.tech/blog/wp-content/uploads/Welcome-1.jpg 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app needed to serve two major purposes: provide all the event-related information to the guests and help them navigation the location. The festival wanted to leave behind the classic printed materials, which are easily lost or forgotten. An app needed to become a digital brochure and location guide that will always be with the visitors, on their mobile devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, Devmind has created a clean and simple app with a smooth user experience that includes features that are essential to event applications. More so, we were able to deliver a solid final product in only </span><b>one month</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, owing to the pre-made modules of the Mobile Roadie platform.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><i>Case Study: A Swimming Equipment Manufacturer</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>A celebrated swimming equipment manufacturer sought out Devmind to build <a href="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/services/mobile-development">mobile applications</a> to help swimmers capture detailed workout statistics.</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping track of workout statistics while swimming is tough and manually counting laps and time passed is nearly impossible while trying to focus on performance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This manufacturer innovates swimming through high-end swim equipment technology designed to help everyone from novices to champions master their technique and provides coaches with the toolkit necessary to instruct and reinforce the fundamental skills of swimming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This equipment is designed for swimmers by swimmers who have a rich background in coaching exceptional swimmers to success. Simply put, no one understands the joy and challenges of swimming better and we were thrilled when they reached out to the <a href="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/services/staffing">Devmind team</a> in the interest of collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The client conducted a broad RFP issuance of development firms over a month period, before narrowing their sights on Devmind’s broad set of development expertise. After screening for relevant project experience with projects of this size and scope, the client choose Devmind as their development partner for this complex Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) project.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<h3><strong>Software That Holds Water</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The swimming equipment manufacturer already had the wearable hardware designed but before they could start tracking key swimming statistics, they needed to <a href="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/services/process-services" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">develop the accompanying software</a> to clearly report personalized activity data to the mobile devices of their users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Devmind built and launched two brand new </span><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/finis-live/id1046561815?ls=1&amp;mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">iOS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.finisinc.live" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Android</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> applications for smartphones and tablets, which pair with two separate Bluetooth 4.0 BLE swimming trackers. The new software uses personalized reports and gamification to encourage users to continue exceeding their own standards in the pool. Thereby giving a boost to the joy and competitive spirit of swimming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With these devices and the accompanying mobile apps, swimmers can:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">set their own goals</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">view detailed reports of their workouts in user profiles</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">synchronize their data on the web</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">automatically record their swimming statistics.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the administrative end, the software enables device authentication across eight different devices and device synchronization for two types of devices, along with comprehensive device management capabilities.</span></p>
<h3><strong>Unbeatable Results</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This innovative wearable <a href="https://www.devmindgroup.tech/solutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">software solution</a> means that manually capturing swimming statistics is now a thing of the past. Swimmers can strap on the company’s hardware and use the software built by Devmind to create a user profile, track workout times, laps, and calories burned, and view detailed progress reports on the web. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For them it means not only more insights into their workout, but less effort spent focusing on capturing time and laps, and more on what they do best: swimming.</span></p>
