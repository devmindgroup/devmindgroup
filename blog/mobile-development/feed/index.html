										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Although iPhone sales slowed down in recent years, one of the biggest and most popular companies in the world hasn’t. Apple continues to improve its ecosystem, finally released a separate OS for iPad, and has maintained its strong stance on privacy.</p>
<p>As the latest WWDC <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18693877/apple-wwdc-2019-privacy-walled-garden-antitrust-developers-app-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showcased</a>, Apple is keen on catering to iOS developers and being a company one would look forward to working with. In fact, a lot has changed for the developers in 2018-2019.</p>
<p>Always keeping track of the latest trends, our developers discuss what’s new in the process of creating software products for iOS and the Apple ecosystem in general. From SwiftUI to addition of reactive libraries to developer program improvements, find out what has changed in the iOS development process in recent years.</p>
<h2>SwiftUI and How Swift Fully Replaces Objective-C</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-18018 size-large" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-1024x601.png" alt="" width="1024" height="601" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-1024x601.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-300x176.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-768x451.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-1536x902.png 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-600x352.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-450x264.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI-1000x587.png 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/SwiftUI.png 1960w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>Over the years, Swift has been slowly but surely replacing Objective-C as the primary language for iOS app development, and 2019 only cemented Swift as the go-to option for the vast majority of iOS developers. The language helps them build apps from the ground up easily, it is more stable, API management is very comfortable, and there’s binary version compatibility. The list goes on — Xcode IDE is evolving and the developers keep adding new features.</p>
<p>WWDC 2019 also saw Apple announce SwiftUI, a development framework that makes coding on Swift faster. The tool indeed saves the engineers’ a lot of time. Arguably the main feature of SwiftUI is the drag-and-drop editor where developers can add content to the app preview and start building the application without manual typing. Other standout features include automatic support for international languages and dark mode. SwiftUI allows developers to build apps with fewer lines of code for every Apple platform and is easy to use overall.</p>
<h2>Apple Strongly Supports Reactive Programming with Combine Framework</h2>
<p>Today most tech giants face strong criticism from their users and software development partners on a range of important issues. Meanwhile, Apple has taken fewer hits and managed to keep its reputation as a software/technology company and commercial company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18693877/apple-wwdc-2019-privacy-walled-garden-antitrust-developers-app-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">almost intact</a>, taking a strong stance on user privacy and catering to their development community at WWDC 2019. So, as Swift keeps getting better, Apple also accommodates other developer groups. This includes those who prefer reactive programming. The paradigm is gaining more and more traction as a better way of building interfaces, so Apple had included more libraries for it not long ago, a big plus for many iOS developers.</p>
<h2>Better API Management, New Tech, Prolonged Device Lifecycle</h2>
<p>The evolution of Xcode over the last two years has led to more intuitive and comfortable API management and more possibilities with it in the Apple ecosystem. New prospects were enabled by the emerging technologies as well as Apple’s all-or-nothing approach to quality the company has been both recognized and criticized for — adding features that were long implemented by others but which work like a charm.</p>
<p>For example, adding a document scanning feature into your iOS app is a breeze now; more sophisticated features like face recognition are similarly easy to implement and are well-realized overall. Other tech, like machine learning algorithms, are a pleasure to tinker with in our era of AI-driven smartphone cameras and photography.</p>
<p>Going back to today’s possibilities of Xcode and Apple’s device politics, the company has been addressing the criticism of their products’ short life cycles in the last two years to great success. The latest iPhone models support the first Watch series, iPhones SE is incredibly snappy on iOS 13.3, and so on. Although this means more testing for software teams, it also means they can cater to a wider audience with their products, as not everybody wants or needs to upgrade to the latest Apple device models often.</p>
<h2>Apple’s Ecosystem Slowly Becomes More Open</h2>
<p>Many developers and users had been criticizing Apple for the lack of control they are given in the Apple ecosystem. That started changing in 2017, when the company introduced a file manager in iOS 11. Two years later, in late 2019, Apple also revealed the very first iPadOS, which addressed most of the criticism that was thrown at Apple since the release of their first tablets at the beginning of the decade. This gave both users and developers significantly more space to operate in.</p>
<p>Surely, Apple is not Android, but the company will likely continue giving more possibilities to both users and developers in the years to come, as these and other changes we discussed above indicate. Apple may be aiming at a happy medium, where, on the one hand, they can control the ecosystem to maintain the high level of quality and ensure privacy and security; and on the other, give developers ample space in their development process and for their ideas.</p>
<h2>Easier App Publishing &amp; Developer Program Improvements</h2>
<p>As for other novelties for the iOS app development process, Apple has tweaked its developer program to introduce more automation at its different steps. For example, developers can integrate new Apple technologies to theirs product quickly and seamlessly across all platforms.</p>
<p>Apple has also enhanced app publishing, the step that remains controversial to some developers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18693877/apple-wwdc-2019-privacy-walled-garden-antitrust-developers-app-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to this day</a>, with the help of AppStore Connect. As a result, iOS developers can publish apps faster and easier today.</p>
<h2>New Security Measures: Fresh Homekit Protocols, App Permissions, Anti-Bot Measures</h2>
<p>What else the developers working with Apple products need to know? Users can now choose whether an app should ask them to allow their location information every time; in other cases, iOS will allow developers to access the data only when the app needs it function.</p>
<p>Apple has also upped the security of HomeKit with new extended security protocols. For instance, the new Secure Video mode encrypts videos locally before sending the data to the cloud.</p>
<p>Finally, there’s Real User Indicator (RUI), a powerful new feature that notifies developers when a new account user may, in fact, be a bot. Apple has not disclosed what are the precise mechanics of the feature, but the company’s spokesperson <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18651359/apple-real-user-indicator-bot-detection-security-feature-ios-13-wwdc-19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> during its presentation that RUI uses on-device intelligence to analyze behaviour and generates a value based on which a developer will know whether a new user is a human or bot.</p>

<h3><b>Top Online Learning Platforms: </b><b>Final Words</b></h3>
<p>No doubt, E-learning is paving its way to shape the way we see education and is no longer perceived as something trivial. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tjmccue/2018/07/31/e-learning-climbing-to-325-billion-by-2025-uf-canvas-absorb-schoology-moodle/#133485633b39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">By 2025 E-learning is predicted to reach revenue of $325 billion.</a> The demand for engaging and interactive learning is rising, and these days learning platforms online can rise again sharply, leaving traditional institutions behind.</p>
<p>Among the main reasons why online learning continues gaining its popularity are affordability, interactivity, and relevance. Generally, massive institutions are falling behind, being unable to adjust the curriculum and the scope of knowledge fast. Nowadays, the demand for particular skills can change overnight, and online platforms can tailor the courses way quicker to meet the needs of learners. Not to mention, the new challenge of being isolated and having to study from home during the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Summing up, quarantine exposed people to many problems, and education has become one of them. However, thanks to endless opportunities open online, not only can we tackle the challenge, but we can also reap all the benefits of having flexible schedules and acquiring relevant knowledge. We hope you have found this guide useful and picked the educational platform that is just right up your street.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The business impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on industries across the world is now profound. Leaders and CIOs should rev up their digital business strategies and position themselves for growth when the pandemic subsides. How exactly should leaders manage this impact and get the most out of opportunities? Here’s our answer.</p>

<p>Today, for the global sectors, COVID-19 presents two challenges: largely idled sectors disrupting trade and reduced demand from consumers. A few examples to consider, Chile is reeling from reduced copper demand. Germany — from auto parts shortage.</p>
<p>In this article, we examine how different industries react to business and economic turbulence caused by the novel pandemic through innovation and digital capabilities. We discover this through <b>the example of 8 industries that try to win over the battle using digital and innovation capabilities.</b></p>
<h2 id="healthcare"><b>Healthcare</b></h2>
<p>As each industry emerges from its acute response phase, many will find that they are entering a “new normal.” Expect the way healthcare is practiced and marketed to be no different.</p>
<p>Beyond the negative impact of a traditional economic downturn, COVID-19 presents additional challenges — fear from the virus itself, collective grief, prolonged physical distancing, and associated social isolation — that will compound the impact on our collective <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/healthcare-systems-and-services/our-insights/helping-us-healthcare-stakeholders-understand-the-human-side-of-the-covid-19-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">health</a>.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19717" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3.jpg" alt="stress Covid" width="1200" height="699" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3.jpg 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-1024x596.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-768x447.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-600x350.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-450x262.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/1-3-1000x583.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Reported signs of distress related to COVID-19 in the US.</i></p>
<p>As the way healthcare is practiced evolves, so too will the environment and platforms through which that care is delivered. There will be new needs that emerge; new content will be needed, in new formats, manifesting in new marketing assets.</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in Healthcare and Other Solutions</h3>
<p>There are three areas that healthcare marketing leaders should focus on, as the impact on their business and the subsequent need to adapt will be significant:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Telehealth</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/digital/telehealth-53-growing-faster-any-other-place-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acceptance and utilization of telehealth</a> services within the US were already on a sharp incline before the COVID-19 crisis erupted countrywide.  Since then, medical and municipal leaders are leveraging the platform as a tool in combating the spread of COVID-19, accelerating adoption in the process.</p>
<p>From a Payer perspective, CVS Health, Aetna, Cigna, and United Health are just a few of the payer organizations recommending patients move to virtual care – going so far as to waive copays for utilizing the service.</p>
<p>Consumers are showing increased interest as well, with <a href="https://www.govtech.com/em/emergency-blogs/disaster-zone/what-are-people-searching-for-on-the-web--relating-to-covid-19.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SEMRush reporting</a> a 146.15% increase in searches for “in-home doctor visits” and a 53.97% increase in “in-home medical care” searches.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Urgent care</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Urgent Care Centers are quickly becoming the front door in a person’s treatment journey.  A study from the Urgent Care Association found that a median of<a href="https://www.ucaoa.org/About-UCA/Industry-News/ArtMID/10309/ArticleID/877/Booming-Urgent-Care-Industry-Filling-the-Gaps-in-Patient-Care" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> 35% of patients utilizing UCCs</a> do not have primary care physicians, reflecting the fact that Healthcare is shifting to much more of an on-demand service. Medicare and Medicaid patients made up almost 27% of UCC patients in 2018, confirming that the shift is not driven only by the young or affluent.</p>
<p>The organization is flanking the physical services with digital efforts, with  <a href="https://cvshealth.com/thought-leadership/cvs-health-names-more-us-cities-for-healthhub-expansion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">almost 30% of the landing pages</a> on CVS.com Minute Clinic specific. Not to be outdone, Walmart<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/business/walmart-health-care-clinics-amazon-cvs/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> launched the first of its augmented health facilities</a> in September 2019.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Almost everything goes online</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Medical conferences and congresses are a huge priority for companies in the Health sector. These events are valued by commercial organizations, advocacy groups, and healthcare professionals as key opportunities for medical education, peer-to-peer engagement, and the release of official study data.</p>
<p>While some of those activities have been digitally distributed in parallel, a vast majority of that activity is face-to-face. The COVID-19 crisis is forcing digital transformation in healthcare industry to take new turns.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #1476f2;"><a style="color: #1476f2;" href="https://www.devmindgroup.com/platforms/healthcare"><b>Devmind Healthcare Solutions</b></a></span></h2>
<p>Since healthcare and economic environments force medical experts to take extra shifts, this greatly affects their own quality and safety of life.</p>
<p>The idea behind Devmind’s solution was to empower medical professionals with a simple tool that gives them flexibility, control, and more. We created an <b>on-demand healthcare staffing solution</b> consisting of two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">iOS and Android app with an Uber-like feel (for the Nurse role);</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Web Admin Panel (for Hospital Administrator or Security Supervisor role).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the most significant features included there are a nurse and hospital management, shift management, notification center, data export, etc. Solutions of this kind can be a major stride within the current time frames because they help doctors stay focused on more essential things and certain patients with reaching for treatments.</p>
<p>As consumers and organizations have no other choice, the COVID-19 crisis is accelerating the utilization of digital platforms. While there have been financial, behavioral, and attitudinal<a href="https://www.jdpower.com/sites/default/files/2019185_telehealth_usage_and_awareness.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> roadblocks</a> to adoption in the past, the need to overcome the crisis is superseding those roadblocks and increases the number of first-time users.</p>
<h2 id="entertainment"><b>E-commerce and Online Shopping</b></h2>
<p>Today, as B2B digital transformation statistics say, online shopping is the fastest-growing slice of the pie, dominating the scene and continuing to invest in digital capabilities.</p>
<p>Traditional, smaller players are also eyeing the online scene. Many traditional small markets have taken to online channels to hawk products, conduct online auctions, and even to carry out customer relation-building, for example, passing tips on how to prepare dishes using their products.</p>
<p>However, most authorities are warning organizations <a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/interviews/coronavirus-spread-preparing-for-the-long-haul-i-4609" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to prepare for the long haul</a>. Virtually every company involved in global trade feels the impact.</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in B2B E-commerce</h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Digitalization had swiftly come into B2B E-commerce sectors a long time ago. But since recent times the situation has drastically changed, the technologies and trends have changed too. Although some things remain untouchable. Still, most of the E-commerce sales are made through mobile devices (</span><a class="_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/806336/mobile-retail-commerce-share-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">73%</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">). Progressive Web App (PWA), with its native-app-like experience, is also here to stay.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Artificial intelligence, machine learning, personalized customer experience, and predefined analytics — all complement an evolution of B2B consumerization. Data remains the primary fuel for accelerating the development of any organization involved in sales. Focusing on eternal questions: what data to collect and how to process it effectively remains unsolved even today. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19718" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2.jpg" alt="social distancing" width="1200" height="1277" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2.jpg 1200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-282x300.jpg 282w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-962x1024.jpg 962w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-768x817.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-600x639.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-423x450.jpg 423w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2-2-940x1000.jpg 940w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>In response to social distancing, many businesses will make their E-commerce operations a key priority.</em></p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Here is what we suggest you can do right now to mitigate the impact of coronavirus on your E-commerce business:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Even as early digitalization investments are paying off, the current inability to fulfill delivery of online purchases suggests digitization efforts by businesses have only been focused at the customer-facing end. Supermarket chains should consider integrating their online shopping platforms with the stock-holding information of their physical branches.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">COVID-19 may accelerate the growth of the online grocery sector. People did not just flock to physical supermarkets, but also loaded virtual carts with groceries from online platforms. With government directives to allow workers to work-from-home and to avoid non-essential trips to shopping malls, this trend of online shopping is likely to persist.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Another possibility is for online shopping platforms to partner with businesses that specialize in delivery fulfillment such as UberEats, Grab, Glovo, and Bolt Food. B2B digital transformation trends are another milestone companies should consider today.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="entertainment"><b>Entertainment</b></h2>
<p>Around the world, COVID-19 is having a marked impact on media supply, consumption, and advertising. Demand for content-streamed, live, and multi-layered — is skyrocketing while new content creation has been largely turned off.</p>
<p>Since cinema and amusement parks across the globe are all shut down for uncertain times, thousands of entertainment organizations suffer formidable losses and fail to receive any kind of income. The outbreak triggered online entertainment and how some companies are finding ways to engage differently with consumers and the new reality.</p>

<h3>Digital Transformation in Entertainment</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Demand for all forms of media — TV programs, short-form video, music streaming, and online gaming, particularly in geographies currently under stay-home instructions, has surged. Digital transformation in entertainment is expecting more new turns in the foreseen future.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">The supply of new content may be limited to a few weeks for some formats (e.g., daytime dramas). New TV series currently being launched were completed prior to production sets shutting down.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Network resiliency and capacity continues to be a focus, as the demand for content surges. In the European Union, streaming platforms are reducing video quality to ensure networks are not overwhelmed and that customers can still view content.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">While sports companies come to terms with a wave of cancellations, many are seeking new ways to reach their customers digitally. Many are looking to eSports or online simulated events to provide content to fans, with even professional athletes engaging in eSports competitions.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Musicians are going online and relying on streaming platforms as live shows are canceled.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="food"><b>Restaurants and Food delivery</b></h2>
<p>Despite some concerns, food delivery companies gain their momentum and become a popular option as people practice social distancing. It&#8217;s hard to pinpoint exactly how much growth there has been in this sector, but higher demand has led to <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/if-the-coronavirus-spreads-in-Zambia-food-delivery-companies-could-see-a-surge-in-demand-are-they-ready-2020-02-28" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">higher pricing</a> in some areas. What more to expect?</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in Food Industry</h3>
<p>Uber, for example, recently provided Uber-only drivers with information on adding Uber Eats food deliveries to their services. Within the first week, around <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/increasing-earning-opportunities-with-uber-eats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15% of Uber drivers</a> had completed their first food delivery.</p>
<p>Fine dining establishments, small-town restaurants, and fast foods are now switching to offer delivery services to their customers. At the same time, restaurants that did not previously offer take-outs are now considering this option as never before. Some restaurants choose a third-party delivery service to partner with, and each offer comes with unique benefits.</p>

<p>Uber Eats and Deliveroo, among others, have launched contactless “leave at your door service” to help drivers and customers follow social distancing and quarantine rules.</p>
<p>In addition to understanding already in place strict food hygiene <a href="https://trans.info/en/covid-19-pandemic-triggers-surge-in-global-food-delivery-industry-178243" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standards</a>, consumers may also be interested to learn if the businesses have:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">New practices for social distancing in the kitchen or during delivery pickups;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Policy for staff members who display symptoms of COVID-19;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Changes in food delivery guidelines, such as containers that allow for easier disinfection or better customer experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Though it is uncertain where the digital transformation in food industry and the delivery trend will go in the post-COVID-19 era, many businesses are working as hard as they can to ensure they meet consumers’ expectations and remain relevant by providing an excellent service.</p>
<h2 id="industry"><b>IT &amp; Tech Industry</b></h2>
<p>The effects of COVID-19 and are having <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/covid-19/understanding-covid-19-s-impact-on-the-technology-sector-.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a significant impact on the technology sector,</a> too. However, the disruption has caused reevaluation on organizations’ business continuity plans (BCPs) as well as the acceleration of remote operations and online meetings. Let&#8217;s dive in to see what has changed more and what solutions organizations appeal to remain afloat.</p>
<h3>Digital Transformation in IT and Other Solutions</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Companies with remote-working technologies already see increased demand as organizations accelerate their remote-working capabilities.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Security software will see third-order benefits from a growing remote workforce. Organizations race to secure endpoints, cloud-based tools, log management, and VPNs. So, IT spending on security software will increase too.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19711" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-scaled.jpg" alt="home teacher" width="2560" height="1709" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-768x513.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-2048x1367.jpg 2048w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-600x400.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-450x300.jpg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/girl-watching-video-using-imac-4144225-1000x667.jpg 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Due to enhanced remote work scenarios, IT digital transformation will play a larger role in future BCPs. Thus, CIOs and senior management will need to ensure a resilient, secure network, disaster recovery systems, and more devices for the ones working remotely.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The need for ever-faster access to data and automation will drive the focus on network equipment and communications, speeding up 5G network and equipment introduction.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An increase in the use of tele- and video-conferencing software as more companies encourage employees to commute.</span></li>

<h2 id="construction"><b>Construction</b></h2>
<p>Today, the most vulnerable industries are those lacking digitalization and tech maturity. The construction industry is one of them.</p>
<p>Creating $1.3 trillion worth of structures each year only in the USA, the construction industry remains one of the most under-digitized industrial sectors. Longer-term construction companies <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/pages/about-deloitte/articles/covid-19/covid-19-s-impact-on-industrial-products---construction-firms.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">across the globe</a> will have to contend with decreased demand as governments face rising deficits, and residential and commercial projects are dampened by unemployment and low GDP growth.</p>
<p>To stay one step ahead of the crisis, the sector requires a different approach to the overall strategy. Digital transformation in construction industry is a burning topic for both — senior management and government. What are the solutions construction companies have today?</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Today, key questions executives and boards should be asking are: do we need to rethink our company’s digital strategy to remain financially solvent, and how can we use technology to gain operational leverage. And the digital transformation in the construction industry becomes inevitable.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19723" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/bbfb.png" alt="construction Covid" width="974" height="472" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/bbfb.png 974w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/bbfb-300x145.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/bbfb-768x372.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/bbfb-600x291.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/bbfb-450x218.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px" /></p>

<h2 id="hospitality"><b>Hospitality</b></h2>
<p>Hospitality is taking proactive financial steps to mitigate the huge impact. It’s obvious today, both revenue and supply chains will be affected the most. Hotels, restaurants, theme parks, cinemas all went silent. The entire disruptive effect of the hospitality industry will have a significant, tremendous impact on the global hospitality industry and economy. And there is a question hangs heavy in the air — can digital transformation in hospitality industry change the rule of the game?</p>
<h3>Solutions</h3>
<p>Despite this, hospitality shows its maturity level: in working together, showing their true hospitality commitments in helping out our society where they can. Technologies like artificial intelligence, big data, connected devices, virtual and augmented realities are shaping the hospitality industry as we speak.</p>

<p>Only during the last two decades dozens of industry disruptors, such as Airbnb, Skyscanner, and TripAdvisor, have appeared on the market. Companies and organizations are expected to get out of the crisis more digitally mature, and those ones who find enough strength to focus on digitalization — are going to win the race. Here are some of the steps to consider today:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">“We may be apart, but we&#8217;ll get through this together,” <a href="https://www.airbnb.co.uk/?_set_bev_on_new_domain=1538581578_Ju69Wm%2FOxIW8lBSY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says Airbnb experts</a> introducing 50 new online experiences with unique activities for their customers. The home-sharing platform curates free online experiences to inspire people and stay afloat.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Digital transformation in the hospitality industry should now be focused on those that we know are available to travel. The dramatic rise in online gambling during COVID-19 lockdowns is one of the results of current circumstances. The online gambling industry is one of the winners of the current shutdown, and some offline casinos and other organizations can consider this as a potential opportunity for future growth.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Smart automation confidently moved into the industry through the Internet of Things technology. It has improved not only the convenience and comfort standards for clients but also reduced costs for businesses and organizations.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Robots that handle food preparation and delivery, predictive analytics, and cloud storage — are the next big moves for automation in the industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the COVID-19 shutdown has brought the industry to a standstill, it is also an opportunity for the companies to reevaluate their digital strategies and map out the right path ahead.</p>

Digital transformation in FinTech triggers a “Big Pocket” battle between incumbents and challengers to win the (newly) online customer. Financial Institutions turn to Tech companies rather than in-house solutions to accelerate digital transformation.</p>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">Mortgage and life insurance digitalization: leaping forward with technology to disrupt the role of intermediaries, whose role was often face-to-face.</li>
</ul>
<p>FinTech&#8217; enablers&#8217; around AI, IoT, and software solutions are in high demand:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">AI: bots for call-centers; account-opening procedures; loan automation;</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">KYC: increased need for safe digital ID given volume of digital business transacted and robust solutions required for the protection of client assets.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sensing">Sensing and Shaping the Post-COVID Era</h2>
<p>Crisis often leads to changes. This time is no exception. The shifts in social attitudes and behaviors we see today pave the broad path to new opportunities and ways of living and working. Some of which is here to stay with us in the long run. Some of which disappear right after the crisis is gone.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19716" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw.png" alt="crisis Covid" width="1209" height="550" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw.png 1209w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-300x136.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-1024x466.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-768x349.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-600x273.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-450x205.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/wwdw-1000x455.png 1000w" sizes="(max-width: 1209px) 100vw, 1209px" /></p>

<p>Nevertheless, some changes show a positive dynamic. For example, we see a greater focus on crisis preparedness, system resilience, social inequality, social solidarity, and access to health care. These attitudinal shifts could, in turn, be reflected in significant policy shifts in many areas, including trade, border controls, health care, crisis preparedness, foreign affairs, employment, and social welfare.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As one of my favorite jokes says, each millennial should ruin a startup, record a podcast, and burn out. Maybe, that won’t be your scenario, but you must have witnessed how contemporary success stories drive masses of entry-level entrepreneurs to at least try that startup idea and launch an app. It promises many inspiring things – like profit generation, positive change expectations, and effective empowerment of the existing business.</p>
<p>However, many people abandon the plan to launch an app once they witness problems in an oversupply of mobile solutions and realize their inability to explain why they fail. At the same time, these reasons are rather objective: either the quality of unsuccessful apps is poor or the essential stages to launch mobile app were violated.</p>
<p>To fix the first issue, you need a team of professionals. But to cure the lack of knowledge about the accurate process to launch an app, you can just read this post.</p>
<p>This comprehensive instruction will help to launch mobile app FOR REAL. It contains 25 steps that can guide you from the raw startup idea to the post-launch maintenance activities of your app:</p>
<p>1. Problem identification<br />
2. Idea choosing<br />
3. Validation<br />
4. Industry research<br />
5. User persona<br />
6. Competitor analysis<br />
7. Positioning<br />
8. Distinguishing main strengths in an app<br />
9. Picking pricing model<br />
10. Branding<br />
11. Landing page publication<br />
12. Completing pre-launch<br />
13. Mockup<br />
14. UI/UX design<br />
15. Coding<br />
16. Beta-testing<br />
17. Gathering tools for data collection<br />
18. App release<br />
19. Rating check<br />
20. Adjusting keywords<br />
21. Publishing early testimonials<br />
22. Working with social media accounts and communities<br />
23. Media outreach company<br />
24. App promotion<br />
25. Reengaging activities</p>
<p>Let’s check how to make each this step right. Rely on the experience of digital geniuses to make your app idea work and impress the world!</p>
<h2>STAGE 1. Accurate planning</h2>
<h3>Step #1. Identify the problem your app will solve</h3>
<p>Many developers not just forget to start from problem identification – they disregard this step completely. By doing this, they make one of the biggest mistakes ever: they face the failure of an overall initiative to launch an app.</p>
<p>That’s why we recommend each young entrepreneur to consider problem-solving approach seriously. Before you let your mind captured by your brilliant ideas or start working on the product itself, calm yourself down by asking, “Which customer pain I want to solve?”. This simple mental exercise can awesomely direct your efforts from making another useless mobile app to something worthy and needed by people.</p>
<p>Once you concentrate on launching a mobile solution (and not just an empty app), even the atmosphere in which you launch mobile app changes. It gifts an additional shot of inspiration, increased motivation, and a sense of purpose – both to yourself and your team.</p>
<p>While identifying customer pain, stick to the basic principle of thinking big and acting small. That will help you accumulate all the necessary experience and suffer from minimum losses. And prepare you to make a really significant change.</p>
<h3>Step #2. Find a good idea</h3>
<p>Once you’ve defined the customer pain you will solve, it’s time to brainstorm ideas. Collect and weigh as many thoughts as possible to make sure the one you’ll choose is the best of the best.</p>
<p>Here’s the way how to make it carefully:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the very beginning, try to gather as many bad ideas as possible. Aim at reaching 100 points in your list of terrible solutions to that sharp problem you’ve noticed on Step #1. Don’t limit your imagination – usually, the great idea appears somewhere between 20th and 80th position. Just don’t stop exploring and creating!</li>
<li>To get some extra inspiration while stuck, investigate forums and thematic groups in social media. Don’t be shy to start conversations with people and test your ideas (or ask strangers for theirs) while talking to those facing the identified pain.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you finally picked a couple of great ideas with which you can launch mobile app, scrutinize them by asking these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Which actions can lead your product to come into the market?</li>
<li>What makes your solution special?</li>
<li>Why should people download your app?</li>
<li>Are you able to develop a sustainable business plan to make it work?</li>
<li>Is it easy to steal and/or copy your idea? How can you protect yourself from this harm?</li>
</ol>
<p>If your idea can stand such interrogation under duress, you can move forward!</p>
<h3>Step #3. Validate your idea</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-18083" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea-200x300.jpeg" alt="How to launch an app Validate your idea" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea-600x900.jpeg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea-300x450.jpeg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea-667x1000.jpeg 667w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Validate-your-idea.jpeg 668w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>To complete the planning stage, create a low-tech prototype you can touch and test. You don’t have to make it detailed and tech-savvy! That’s a technological representation of an app purpose you’ve created in your head, nothing more. On this stage, you just need to check whether everything you’ve identified in your idea checklist can be reflected in the form of a digital solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>STAGE 2. Conducting research</h2>
<h3>Step #4. Investigate the industry</h3>
<p>Before you dive into the development stage and actually launch mobile app, learning the market context is none the worse for. To conduct industry research, play with Google Keyword Planner and AppAnnie tools. SEO and PPC specialists frequently use them, and there’s no surprise – these instruments provide you with useful insights into what people search in Google and which keywords are relevant for your specific market niche. Lucky you, that’s the basic information to launch an app too.</p>
<h3>Step #5. Create a user persona</h3>
<p>In addition to understanding the market, it’s essential to know your customers well. Spend a fair amount of time to learn their demographical traits, tastes, typical behaviors, and attitudes. All these data will make your users attracted by the product you’ll create for them.</p>
<p>After you’ve collected all the relevant information, create the user persona. This method makes you think of an ideal client – the one who contains the most typical features and reveals the most common patterns you’ve identified.</p>
<p>Here’s the process of how to work on user persona:</p>
<ol>
<li>Include raw data: age, location, specification, relationship status, etc;</li>
<li>Draft a typical bio to create the story of your user persona;</li>
<li>Add sections with wishes, needs, and common fears to capture the emotional portrait;</li>
<li>Include relevant skills and specifications;</li>
<li>List favorite brands, food, and places (or any other details relevant for your research).</li>
</ol>
<h3>Step #6. Analyze competitors</h3>
<p>Finally, you won’t get the full picture of the context without checking the behavior and business tactics of your main rivals. The easiest way to search for your key competitors is to read Google articles dedicated to the top 10 companies in your niche. Your direct competitors are those several ones that appear the most frequently.</p>
<p>While researching your competitors, ask them these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Who are their target users?</li>
<li>Why are they so popular?</li>
<li>Which exact keywords make their ranking that high?</li>
<li>What do customer reviews say?</li>
<li>What did they look over (and so, my app can improve)?</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Collecting these answers will make you confident about the cheerful prospects of your future success!</p>

<h2>STAGE 3. App launch marketing plan</h2>
<h3>Step #7. Develop Positioning Statement</h3>
<p>So, once you’ve convinced yourself and your market that an idea created in your head should see the world, it’s time to start marketing! The proper start is to create your positioning statement that addresses three main questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who will use my app?</li>
<li>What advantage does it bring to these people?</li>
<li>Why is this app more valuable to my users than all the other apps available?</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’ve elaborated your answers to these questions, all the marketing steps you’d take in the future should empower that statement – again and again. That will contribute to your brand awareness.</p>
<p>Remember: your task is to create something special, valuable, and different from all those millions of apps available in AppStore. Dedicate maximum attention to creating your Unique Value Proposition – that’s the phrase that will hook your target audience and convince them to stay with you. And yes, never deceive your positioning statement ever after.</p>
<h3>Step #8. Define your main strengths</h3>
<p>The completion with other apps will be cruel, so you need to spend some time designing the list of all the counterarguments you will use to fight them all.</p>
<p>For useful insights, refer to these two sources of information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Competitor’s reviews. Learn the key problems other apps reaching your target customers have experienced – and solve them in your solution.</li>
<li>Marketing channels missed. If your competitors don’t use YouTube, blogs, or Product Hunt – well, you know what does it mean for you, right?</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, pay attention to the most common pricing models, the level of customer satisfaction, and the frequency and quality of version updates. On all these weaknesses, you can build your power.</p>
<h3>Step #9. Choose the best pricing model</h3>
<p>Depending on the aims of your app and the expectations your target customers carry, you can use different approaches to asking for money in your app. The most common model is “freemium,” which means that users are granted free access to the limited version of a product, but its full functionality is available upon subscription. Alternatively, you can go for free, subscription-based, or in-app purchases models.</p>
<p>To make the final decision, consider the size of your audience: if it’s a niche market, you can risk and launch an app that is downloaded for money. If your task is to reach maximum people, that’s possible with a free solution only.</p>
<h3>Step #10. Develop branded screenshots and visuals for marketing</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-18085" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-300x200.jpeg" alt="How to launch an app - Develop branded screenshots and visuals for marketing" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-450x300.jpeg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing-1000x667.jpeg 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Develop-branded-screenshots-and-visuals-for-marketing.jpeg 1050w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Complete pre-marketing activities by developing the brand book of your app. It doesn’t mean designing a comprehensive mobile marketing campaign – but you need to notify about the app release date and construct the overall brand awareness from scratch.</p>
<p>Never miss the chance to tell the story of your app. Design various beautiful visuals with the emotional appeal in different formats – you can use them as materials for press, social media banners, creative elements in the e-mail marketing campaigns, etc. Also, pay attention to the promo video. With it, you can both introduce your product and reengage customers over and over again (in social media posts, on a landing page, and in the description on AppStore).</p>
<p>Complete the package you’ll send to influencers and press. In its visual part, it should include a logo, an icon, screenshots, and the promo.</p>
<h2>STAGE 4. Pre-Launch Activities</h2>
<h3>Step #11. Publish a landing page for your app</h3>
<p>Even though your efforts are mostly connected with the need to launch a mobile app, don’t underestimate the potential of a website in empowering your success. Generally, a landing page can help you in several ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>It facilitates checking whether your idea is really profitable and viable,</li>
<li>It enables collecting e-mails of your first clients and communicating with them,</li>
<li>It’s useful for lead generation,</li>
<li>It’s effective in showcasing all the product advantages, customer reviews, and press references.</li>
</ol>
<p>To create a landing page, register your domain, fill all the relevant information, and add a submission form for your visitors to leave their e-mails. To make it quick, use the services like Instapage, Wix, LaunchRock, and Unbounce. Also, don’t forget to link your landing page with services for data collection and analytics – you won’t regret having direct access to Google Analytics and Optimizely.</p>
<p>Use your landing page to pitch your app idea, share private beta versions to test your product on its development stage, communicate its positioning and strengths, and promote it on a post-launch stage!</p>
<h3>Step #12. Complete all the preparations to app launch campaign</h3>
<p>At this stage, you complete all the warming up before diving into the hard development. Use all the information you’ve gathered to complete the pre-launch checklist!</p>
<ol>
<li>Complete the product description page. Use all the information you’ve gathered on the previous steps to create a catching text that describes your app to clients. It should work for the perfect advertising of your app.</li>
<li>Determine the main influencers in your industry and establish communication with them. Don’t underestimate the role of networking and communication – especially if you just entered the market with the new product.</li>
<li>Craft app promotion campaign. Create the list of advertising activities you’ll launch in various marketing channels – social media, communication with bloggers, traditional advertising platforms, and the way your website will work.</li>
<li>Prepare a press kit. Create a directory that contains the most powerful information about your app (both visual and textual), the list of all the platforms where you’re present (website, forums, social media), and your contact information. Send it to press representatives.</li>
</ol>

<h2>STAGE 5. Development</h2>
<h3>Step #13. Create the mockup</h3>
<p>So, everything is ready to start developing your product! For one thing, create a basic sketch of your product. Omit using mixed colors and including sophisticated heavy details – all you need to do is to outline the main blocks and their connections. Aim at creating a general perspective with the basic interactions and overall app flow on this step.</p>
<p>Here’s the process of creating a mockup:</p>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ol>
<li>Write down basic app functionality and user interface features your digital solution must have</li>
<li>Create a series of screens for each element</li>
<li>Draft requirements for UI – include general elements first, then add some essential details</li>
<li>Add supporting notes with explanations where needed</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The mockup is like a pencil sketch, not a complete picture. Prefer blue-sky thinking about general concepts to down-to-earth back-breaking detail-drawing. You’re just preparing yourself.</p>
<h3>Step #14. Apply graphic design</h3>
<p>That’s where your maximum attention to the details is the main requirement. Your final task is to show how the app will look – from point to point, in a complete color palette, and containing all the layouts and UI elements. That’s the step where each centimeter and each pixel matter.</p>
<p>And that’s a high time to invite UX/UI professional. Only this specialist can complete this task as well as your app needs. Don’t skimp and save here – the major part of your success depends on the beauty and usability of UI/UX design specifically.</p>
<h3>Step #15. Code</h3>
<p>This is another hard-working step that is a prerequisite to the appearance of your app. Similar to the case of the design, the importance of coding calls for the best programming specialist you can find.</p>
<p>Think of the number of platforms you’re aiming at. You can launch an app for iOS or Android (good native coding platforms Xcode and Swift). Alternatively, you can invest in cross-platform solutions – here, pay attention to React Native, Flutter, and Xamarin as useful tools. Finally, check out Parse.com and Firebase – they are great backend-as-a-service instruments to work with data assets.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to check the guidelines of the platforms you’ve chosen – to ensure the submission process will go smoothly and bug-free.</p>
<h3>Step #16. Beta-test</h3>
<p>The more features and platforms your app needs, the greater the importance of beta-testing. Precisely, it’s necessary to fix as many problems as possible before you launch your mobile app – otherwise, the whole product can alienate your target customers once and for long. So, always check your progress through both internal and external testing of your app. Reach your fans, friends, and even friends of your friends to collect all the data and testimonials needed to ensure you’ll celebrate your launch, not save your solution from losses and bugs. Try TestFlight, a solution that allows beta testing of your app both internally and externally.</p>
<p>Of course, all this doesn’t mean that beta-testing will save your product from ALL the glitches you’ll notice after the release. You just need to make sure you’ve done everything possible to prevent those bugs and mistakes that appear in the early development stages.</p>
<h3>Step #17. Prepare technical tools to leverage audience and collect data on your app</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-18087 size-medium" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app-200x300.jpeg" alt="How to launch an app - Prepare technical tools to leverage audience and collect data on your app" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app-200x300.jpeg 200w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app-600x900.jpeg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app-300x450.jpeg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app-667x1000.jpeg 667w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Prepare-technical-tools-to-leverage-audience-and-collect-data-on-your-app.jpeg 668w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /></p>
<p>We highly recommend developing in-app messaging in advance. This will help you collect precious feedback – both on the beta-testing step and long after the launch.</p>
<p>Also, connect services that will help you work with analytics right before launching. For this purpose, the best picks are Crashlink (to work with crashes), Google Analytics (to measure engagement), and Fastlane (for better automation).</p>
<p>Aaaand… are you ready for the next long-expected step?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s already Step #18, but that finally happened. It’s time to celebrate launching an app!</p>
<p>The vital task here is to let everybody you can reach know the news and open the champagne to celebrate this happening with your team!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>STAGE 7. Post-launch activities</h2>
<h3>Step #19. Keep track of your rating</h3>
<p>In the first couple of weeks, don’t lose your sense of reality and constantly check your performance. For this, rely on prepared KPIs and work with the metrics on a daily basis.</p>
<p>In the beginning, get ready to face high volatility in your rankings. Simply get track of rating, reviews, the number of downloads, and retention rate. This objective information will help you see the bigger picture and provide a sustainable background for the first updates.</p>
<h3>Step #20. Immediately adjust your keywords (if needed)</h3>
<p>Among the prior changes on the post-launch stage, prepare to revise the keywords. Having a tremendous impact on your ranking in both AppStore and Google Play, keywords, if changed on time, can improve your position dramatically.</p>
<p>Among the fields to revise, pay attention to the app’s title, the list of meta keywords, and meta description. The make all the difference.</p>
<h3>Step #21. Get early testimonials</h3>
<p>For the post-launch stage, it’s all about reviews. You should provoke, collect, and process them. At the same time, we recommend not only checking the reviews left by your customers but also adjust your description with the best examples. Doing this can increase trust to you and boost popularity – especially if you get somebody like Leonardo di Caprio among your reviewers!</p>
<p>Just don’t be shy and ask influencers and celebrities for the review by yourself! Both critics and fans contribute to your success. Besides, they attract new users who judge your product by reading reviews and scanning descriptions – so update the review list and description info as often as it’s needed to make it perfect!</p>
<h3>Step #22. Develop social media accounts and reach existing online communities</h3>
<p>Among the most important areas to develop on the post-launch stage, pay attention to users who gather in social media, blogs, and forums. Link your social accounts to your landing page so that your audience can reach you on both platforms. Invest in social media and content marketing – but do it wisely. Be active in thematic Facebook groups and on Instagram. Talk to your customers and search for immediate insights into your market. And also, keep an eye on influencers in your industry and develop strategical partnerships.</p>
<p>There are so many ways to use social media for your app. Don’t neglect their potential!</p>
<h3>Step #23. Work on media outreach strategy</h3>
<p>Along with working on social media, it’s crucial to establish beneficial communication with the press. In this context, rely on the value of your product and your unique selling points. By building relations with journalists and bloggers, communicate your story to build sincere connections. To find your audience, use Google News, Reverse Google Image Search, and Help-A-Reporter-Out (HARO).</p>
<p>And never forget to show them your awesome brand book!</p>
<h3>Step #24 Promote your app</h3>
<p>Marketing strategy constantly supplements your app launch – but it gets the solemnity on the post-launch stage. You can do many things here – and reviewing them deserves a separate post.</p>
<p>That’s why we list you just some ideas for you to investigate and get more target customers:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Participate in the curated lists,</li>
<li>Apply paid advertising,</li>
<li>Try App Store Optimization (ASO),</li>
<li>Use push notification,</li>
<li>Use A/B testing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step #25 Reengage your users</h3>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-18089" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-300x200.jpeg" alt="How to launch an app - Reengage your users" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-768x512.jpeg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-600x400.jpeg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-450x300.jpeg 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users-1000x667.jpeg 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/How-to-launch-an-app-Reengage-your-users.jpeg 1051w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p>Finally, you should never forget about the people who already chose to stay with your app. Entertain them with new content and fresh updates. Keep an eye on their behavior. Remain the perfect app for their needs.</p>
<p>And, of course, carefully listen and instantly react to the feedback you receive from your fans. From the very beginning, you initiated an app to solve their problem – so, at the end of the app launch journey, you should always stick to this purpose to not only keep your ratings high but also ensure you create value.</p>
<h2>Final note: How much does it cost to launch an app?</h2>
<p>If we reached our aim of writing this post, the task of launching an app should not seem hard for you anymore. The only thing to cover is the revealing the amount of resources you’ll need to start.</p>
<p>This answer depends on many factors: the app type you want to develop, the exact number of platforms, design sophistication, databases used, the appearance of adds-on, etc. With the different combinations of these factors, the sum can range from $10,000 to $500,000.</p>
<p>So, it’s always better to contact the development team and get the real price from them. Compare different teams to make the final choice.</p>
<p>We wish good luck with your app launch – and let you open many bottles of champagne for success!</p>

Meanwhile, Happify’s approaches were developed by leading scientists and experts in positive psychology, cognitive behavioural therapy, and mindfulness. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happify was widely praised by users and media, including reviews in ABC World News and The New York Times. The company also claims that eight-six percent of their regular users report improved well-being in two month since they started using the app. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Happify is available for iOS and Android. Part of the features are free, while the rest can be accessed by subscribing. </span></p>
<h2><strong>What Makes Top Mental Health Succeed</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a pattern to why the aforementioned mental health apps enjoy success — they all tick the same important boxes. Here are the success factors:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mental health professionals should be involved in as many stages as possible</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app should have a diverse set of features for a user to choose from </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The features should be backed up by scientific research</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app should have its unique feature, or approach a common feature from a different angle</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mood journal is an important feature</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gamification helps to keep the users engaged</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The app should have an appealing design</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have taken a closer look at the top apps for mental health and what makes them so, you can start planning your own unique mobile product for those who want to tackle their mental health issues in a handy, clear, and pleasant way.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growing popularity of smartphones over recent years has changed how people read news and articles forever. In a change-or-die situation, media companies needed to adapt fast, creating comprehensive digital strategies. As smartphones became the cornerstone of our everyday lives, mobile apps needed to be at the center of those strategies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, many news apps showcase that a life without print editions and newstands (or only a small number of them), which might come sooner than later, may not be something readers and media companies should be concerned about. If they are properly made, news apps not only carry over the look and feel of newspapers and magazines to mobile, they also give the media new ways and angles to provide coverage, in one place and to a global reader base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are five hand-picked news apps that deliver on that promise today. Use our list to get inspired for your own news app, find yourself a new news sources, or simply explore examples of all-around great mobile products. </span></p>
<h2><strong>The New York Times (iOS)</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if you prefer paper editions of newspapers over news apps, it is hard to deny that the New York Times did a great job of carrying over their long-established aesthetic and reporting to mobile. It is just that: the same New York Times, only more visually appealing and handy and available anywhere you want to read it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The user experience and design are outstanding: sections are well-organized (with quick access to Saved for Later and Recently Viewed), navigation is quick and simple, and the app’s clean visuals are really easy on the eye. Whether you want to quickly read the morning briefing or enjoy evening articles from the newspaper’s many sections, you will have a pleasant experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everything’s good under the hood as well: there are no crashes and bugs, and the pages load quite quickly even with poor internet connection. The app has ads, but they are non-intrusive and fit into the design organically. </span></p>

<!-- #tablepress-4 from cache -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to sections, the New York Times app has it all: from the standard Opinion, World, Business and sport — to sections on health and wellness, entertainment and arts, as well as video and podcasts, among many others. You can also access the day’s paper in the corresponding section. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a well-produced “Immersive” section that is dedicated to AR and VR news content, the NYT doubles down on the notion that mobile and digital technology hold the potential to give new life to the media by giving readers new exciting perspectives and angles. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Readers can access a limited number of articles for free every month or subscribe to one of the plans.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Al Jazeera English</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apart from its appealing and intuitive design, what makes the Al Jazeera app stand out is the emphasis on live news. They are quickly accessible in a video or audio stream and equally comfortable to watch on a smartphone or tablet. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Al Jazeera understands the needs of modern users better than other media companies: the app has two more video sections alongside the Live broadcast — on-demand programming and documentaries. Other sections feature top stories, latest news, and  opinion pieces. </span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17250 " src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-606x1024.png" alt="Al Jazeera news app" width="526" height="889" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-606x1024.png 606w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-178x300.png 178w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-600x1013.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-266x450.png 266w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231-592x1000.png 592w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Al-Jazeerah-English-Screenshot-e1570039896231.png 639w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can personalize your feed in the “My Feed” section, which provide quick access to bookmarked topics, saved pages, and programmes. That being said, navigating Al Jazeera English is a breeze. Even on smaller screens, there is a lot of breathing space, and the sections are well-organized in general. </span></p>
<p><b>Sections include</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Arts &amp; Culture, Business &amp; Economy, Environment, Poverty &amp; Development, Human Rights and more, as well as a separate section that covers different regions of the world. Readers can also access archived content. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Al Jazeera English is free-of-charge. </span></p>
<h2><strong>New Yorker Today</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like the New York Times, The New Yorker magazine has managed to go mobile with great success. Capturing the look and feel of the magazine really well, New Yorker Today serves three goals: delivers the latest news, opinion pieces, articles, and writing; provide quick access to the decade-spanning library ot its widely celebrated cartoons; give fast access to the magazine library with the latest and archive issues.</span></p>

<table id="tablepress-3" class="tablepress tablepress-id-3">
<tbody class="row-hover">
<tr class="row-1 odd">
	<td class="column-1"><img src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-New-Yorker-Today-Screenshot-1-e1570039979160-595x1024.png" alt="New Yorker Today News App" width="595" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17251" /></td><td class="column-2"><img src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/The-New-Yorker-Screenshot-2-e1570040009372-595x1024.png" alt="New Yorker Today news app" width="595" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17252" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<!-- #tablepress-3 from cache -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although its website and magazine app can stand on their own and can be used separately, New Yorker Today seems to be aimed at readers who want to access the most popular parts of the The New Yorker’s digital experience in one place. </span></p>
<p><b>Sections:</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Latest news and writing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cartoon randomizer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital edition of the magazine (differs from the magazine app)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bookmarks and history</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a limited number of free-to-read articles and a range of subscription options available for readers.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Pocket</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as news apps go, Pocket is not a typical media product. At its heart is a simple promise of letting users save articles and web pages for later reading and viewing, but it delivers on it to the fullest. If you read news alongside articles from different publications, but do not want to assault your eyes with the endless stream of headlines of news aggregator apps (or simply find the look and feel of Instapper uninspiring), Pocket will your top choice.</span></p>

<table id="tablepress-5" class="tablepress tablepress-id-5">
<tbody class="row-hover">
<tr class="row-1 odd">
	<td class="column-1"><img src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pocket-Web-App-Screenshot-e1570040455244-618x1024.png" alt="Pocket news app" width="618" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17259" /></td><td class="column-2"><img src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Pocket-App-Screenshot-e1570040471323-597x1024.png" alt="" width="597" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17260" /></td>

<!-- #tablepress-5 from cache -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket is integrated with all popular browsers on desktop and mobile and with over fifteen thousand apps, making it quick and simple to save articles anywhere you find them. There are many instruments for managing them too. You can always locate the right article quickly with tags and a number of sections — all put together nicely in an extremely comfortable-to-use design. Other features include choosing the background color and highlighting text, listening to any article, and following friends to find out what they are reading.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of this comes for free, but you can get extra features like advanced search and fonts with the paid premium version. There is also a section of curated articles from numerous different publications updated everyday as well as a tool to look for them yourself across different categories. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pocket is continuously updated, bug-free, and the user experience is equally satisfying in the web app and native apps (although you cannot listen to articles in the web app). Interestingly, It is in-built into the Firefox browser and is owned by its creators, the Mozilla Corporation. </span></p>
<h2><b>TechCrunch</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The shiny look and handy navigation of TechCrunch’s website can be enjoyed in any browser, but you might just opt for the publication’s app instead. It bares the visual style of the website, but provides a more focused, personalised, and ad-free experience. </span></p>

<table id="tablepress-6" class="tablepress tablepress-id-6">
<tbody class="row-hover">
<tr class="row-1 odd">
	<td class="column-1"><img src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TechCrunch-App-Screenshot-e1570040577401-606x1024.png" alt="TechCrunch tech news app" width="606" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17263" /></td><td class="column-2"><img src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/TechCrunch-Screenshot-2-e1570040612672-608x1024.png" alt="TechCrunch tech news app" width="608" height="1024" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17264" /></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<!-- #tablepress-6 from cache -->
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Following the latest tech news with the TechCrunch app is easy, fast, and comfortable. You can browse the headlines of the latest news and bookmark them right in the feed. One more section gathers topics of your choice in one place, and you can manage or stay notified about them right in this section. Finally, there is “Saved for Later,” where you can read the bookmarked articles. You can also access the latest TechCrunch videos at the beginning of the main feed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, the TechCrunch app streamlines reading tech news to the maximum, delivering a snappy experience without ads, bugs, and free-of-charge. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are seeking new ways to engage your customers, need to reach millennials in the right place at the right time, or want to get inspired to create your own unique marketing product, we have hand-picked five unique examples of stand-out marketing tools for different channels and purposes.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A marketing director of an established brand with a young audience, an aspiring entrepreneur, a digital marketing manager, a senior-level manager at a big organization — everyone will find something interesting in our list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s start.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Media — WeAre8 </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeAre8 is a unique mobile platform for influencers and micro-influencers that helps them connect with their favorite brands to get paid for sponsorships. Influencers download the WeAre8 mobile app, sync their social media accounts, and can receive sponsorships in a personalized feed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are over thirty vertical feeds available, including fashion and style, technology, visual arts, music, and wellness and sports. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are three  ways to get sponsored:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share branded content across social media channels</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch and respond to videos from brands</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Create unique content</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a user gets paid, they can cash out to a PayPal account, or donate to a charity of their choice.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-17179" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/WeAre8-App-Promo-Image.png" alt="Best marketing tools" width="354" height="630" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/WeAre8-App-Promo-Image.png 443w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/WeAre8-App-Promo-Image-168x300.png 168w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/WeAre8-App-Promo-Image-253x450.png 253w" sizes="(max-width: 354px) 100vw, 354px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">WeAre8 positions itself as a people’s platform for those who want to have a solid side hustle. The platform partners with over thirty-six charities and donates five percent of brand spend as part of its business model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Meanwhile, any brand working with WeAre8 has direct access to millions of influencers worldwide, with a combined social following that exceeds 1.2 billion users. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mobile — App Platform Mobile Roadie</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Launched in 2009, Mobile Roadie is the first Do-it-Yourself (DIY), no-code app builder in the history of software development. Its creators recognized that mobile will become a powerful marketing tool, creating a universal, rich-featured, and intuitive app builder for businesses across industries. Mobile Roadie is still highly popular today, powering ups apps of Madonna, Dallas Mavericks, Wynn Las Vegas, San Diego Zoo, and more. </span></p>
<p><b><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17180" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot-1024x561.png" alt="digital marketing tools" width="1024" height="561" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot-1024x561.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot-300x164.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot-768x421.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot-600x329.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot-450x247.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot-1000x548.png 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-Roadie-Screenshot.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The platform uses a drag-and-drop editor and ready-made feature modules to allow businesses to quickly build and customise native iOS and Android apps with unique design. It also includes a comprehensive content management system (CMS), and a data dashboard with insightful app analytics that let business learn more about their customers. </span></p>
<p><strong>Mobile Roadie’s pre-made features include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Media: music, audio, video, podcasts, photos</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interactive map</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Events and schedule </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chat wall</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In-app ads and purchases</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Push notifications</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pop-up promos</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geofenced messages</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Polls</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rewards,</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Augmented reality</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beacons, and other features</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In sum, a business gets a mobile presence, a set of engagement tools, and means to learn more about their users — faster and at a fraction of the cost as compared to custom software development. If a company wants to go above and beyond with their app, they can hire the Mobile Roadie team to do custom development as part of three different packages aimed at the look, functionality, and business needs.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Content Marketing — Unsplash</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it is an enterprise or a new neighbourhood restaurant in New York City, Unsplash is a real find for marketing efforts in any company. If the inherent mediocrity of the likes of Shutterstock tires you, or producing quality visuals and photos for your content takes more time than your team has, Unsplash provides just the right solution. </span></p>
<p><b><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-17181" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2-1024x561.png" alt="online marketing tools" width="1024" height="561" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2-1024x561.png 1024w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2-300x164.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2-768x421.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2-600x329.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2-450x247.png 450w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2-1000x548.png 1000w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Unsplash-2.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Free of charge to this day, Unsplash started out as a place where professional, amateur and mobile photographers as well as visual artists uploaded their photos, both sharing and promoting their work (the user is always reminded to copyright the author when they download a picture, but it is not obligatory). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the start, Unsplash reminded a more slick and elevated version of Instagram without comments and influencers, where you could browse beautiful photos, finding something for a social media page of a small business like a coffee shop. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it successfully saved that allure, today’s Unsplash can cover the needs of the vast majority of industries, from embedded software development to building construction to island festivals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need a crisp, attention-grabbing image, Unsplash is a go-to platform: you can always find something to make your blog or social media post stand out from the crowd. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsplash is also a forward-thinking platform: the like count was removed and the newly introduced monetization is organic, as businesses put advertising in Unsplash-styled photos in an intrusive way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Unsplash is just a pleasure to use wherever you click. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Voice Advertising — Spotify Ad Studio</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a world that overwhelms your customers with visual information from all sides and screens, voice advertising is having a big moment alongside the enduring popularity of podcasts and music streaming. A properly put together voice ad is not only effective, but less intrusive as compared to different types of visual ads filling the numerous screens of your users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Spotify for Brands</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> ad suite, Spotify Ad Studio is a self-service audio ad platform that lets brands create great ads in three easy steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating an ad. You can pass the script to the Spotify team, and they will record a voiceover, mix the music, and produce it at no extra cost. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audience targeting. You target users based on their age, gender, location, activity, music or podcast taste, as well as choose on what platforms to air it. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campaign customization. The last thing you need to do to launch the campaign is set a budget and dates. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Key platforms include mobile tablet, desktop, web. Platforms like gaming console, connected TV, and connected car are available in some markets.  </span></p>
<p><iframe title="Spotify Ad Studio: Why Advertise on Spotify?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Lu4UfR6oNE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also two advertising options aimed at Spotify Free users. With </span><b>interest targeting</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, brands can engage users based on activities and topics they like (determined by their podcast, playlists, and platform preferences). The feature works in three categories — comedy, technology, and cooking. The second one is </span><b>real-time context targeting</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, allowing brands to reach users at specific moments during the day, like a morning run or dinner. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a twenty-nine million ad-supported users and a set of measurement tools, Spotify Ad Studio may be a fitting choice for your next voice ad campaign. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the process of creating any mobile or web application, you should make sure every component is well-built. Even the smallest problems that may arise in the process of creating a mobile app architecture can undermine the quality of the final result. As the saying goes, if you want to do something, do it well. This is why every popular Android and iOS application has a highly reliable mobile app architecture and successfully wins over its users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is mobile app architecture? It is a set of structural elements and their interfaces from which the system is composed, as well as their behavior in the framework of all structural elements. It can be said that this is the skeleton of a program and the whole work of the mobile application is determined by its quality. By missing an important element in creating a mobile app architecture you endanger the success of your project. The complexity of building high-quality architecture depends on the size of the application. Proper architecture will allow for saving a lot of time, energy, and costs in the future.</span></p>
<h2><b>Mobile App Architecture Diagram</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First of all, having the right architecture means that your mobile application is independent of external resources. All successful projects that are now running on iOS and Android were created by the manual labor of developers and were not subjected to the use of frameworks or similar means. Architecture should not rely on the existence of any library. So you can use frameworks as tools, and not try to drive your system into their limitations. Your mobile application architecture diagram should not be exposed to other operating systems and databases so that it can function regardless of the status of other programs.</span></p>
<h2><b>Mobile App Architecture Example</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good architecture is first and foremost a profitable architecture that makes the process of developing and maintaining a program simpler and more efficient. A program with a good architecture is easier to expand and change, and also to test, debug, and understand. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, the Clean Architecture is a good fit for large scale projects with big budgets. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of architecture is universal, allowing for installation of various plug-ins and quick troubleshooting, but it should not be created using frameworks. Program code must be written from scratch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s look at an example of successfully implemented mobile application architecture:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16548" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram.jpg" alt="Mobile App Architecture Diagram" width="599" height="440" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram.jpg 772w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram-300x220.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram-768x564.jpg 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram-600x441.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram-450x331.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each layer of such a mobile application is independent of other programs and components, and entitles is a key fragment containing the logic of your application and important objects. All layers are connected by the Dependency Rule, which states that in the source code all dependencies can only be specified internally. For example, nothing from the outer circle can be mentioned by a code from the inner circle. This applies to functions, classes, variables, or any other entity.</span></p>
<h2><b>Android Mobile App Architecture</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2012, the structure of app development projects looked very simple. Developers did not have any libraries to work with the network, and AsyncTask was still an important component in the creation of Android mobile app architecture. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let&#8217;s look at the classic system of creating architecture for Android applications:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16549" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Android-Mobile-App-Architecture.png" alt="Android Mobile App Architecture" width="512" height="263" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Android-Mobile-App-Architecture.png 512w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Android-Mobile-App-Architecture-300x154.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Android-Mobile-App-Architecture-450x231.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In today’s reality, the implementation of Clean Architecture is the best solution for reliable operation. This architecture will allow your application to be independent from frameworks, databases, and more. Transitions between layers in such Android mobile app architecture are carried out through Boundaries, that is, through two interfaces: one for the request, and one for the answer. They are needed so that the inner layer does not depend on the outer layer (following the Dependency Rule), but at the same time it can transmit data to it:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16550" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram.png" alt="Mobile App Architecture Diagram" width="325" height="272" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram.png 394w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Mobile-App-Architecture-Diagram-300x251.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order for a dependency in such an Android mobile application architecture to be directed towards the reverse flow of data, the principle of dependency inversion is applied (the letter D from the abbreviation SOLID). That is, instead of Uses Cases being directly dependent on the Presenter (which would violate the Dependency Rule), they depend on the interface in its layer, and the Presenter must implement this interface.</span></p>
<h2><b>iOS Mobile App Architecture</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The standard iOS mobile app architecture can be divided into four blocks:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kernel level (Core OS) — works with the file system, controls the validity of various certificates belonging to the applications. Also responsible for the security of the entire system. Contains low-level access to the elements of the device.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Core Services (Core Service) — provides access to databases and file controls.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Media level (Media) — contains tools that allow for processing most media data formats.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interface level (Cocoa Touch) — has many elements for creating mobile interfaces, and also provides the remaining layers with information coming from the user.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A MVC (Massive View Controller) and its prototypes are used to create a high-quality iOS mobile application architecture. Cocoa MVC encourages you to write Massive View Controller, because the controller is so involved in the View life cycle that it is difficult to say that it is a separate entity. Although you still have the opportunity to ship some of the business logic and data conversion in the Model, when it comes to shipping work in View, you have few options:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16551" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/iOS-Mobile-App-Architecture.png" alt="iOS Mobile App Architecture" width="638" height="204" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/iOS-Mobile-App-Architecture.png 800w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/iOS-Mobile-App-Architecture-300x96.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/iOS-Mobile-App-Architecture-768x246.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/iOS-Mobile-App-Architecture-600x192.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/iOS-Mobile-App-Architecture-450x144.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, the entire responsibility of the View is to send actions to the controller. In the end, it all ends with the View Controller becoming a delegating part and a data source, as well as a place to start and cancel server requests.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-16552" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Enterprise-Mobile-App-Architecture.png" alt="Enterprise Mobile App Architecture" width="719" height="405" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Enterprise-Mobile-App-Architecture.png 820w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Enterprise-Mobile-App-Architecture-300x169.png 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Enterprise-Mobile-App-Architecture-768x433.png 768w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Enterprise-Mobile-App-Architecture-600x338.png 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Enterprise-Mobile-App-Architecture-450x254.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px" /></p>
<h2><b>Enterprise Mobile App Architecture</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For the successful functioning of their businesses, many companies use corporate applications that make it easy for the client and employees to communicate with the company. Inside the application, functions of monitoring, purchases, communication, and filtering services and products from the company are used. For a modern business, one of the priorities is the strategic use of IT technologies and the implementation of business objectives in such a way as to gain a competitive advantage in the market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time, in the enterprise mobile app architecture there is often a discrepancy between the IT infrastructure and business requirements, which is caused by rapid market changes. The problems of the information architecture of business solutions are most often associated with insufficient speed and low scalability, unreliability, as well as the complexity of updating and maintaining software.</span></p>
<h2><b>Mobile Application Architecture Properties</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we know that for high-quality, uninterrupted operation of your mobile application, it is recommended to use the Clean mobile application architecture. When creating a suitable platform for the convenience of your client and employees, you need to follow a few tips that will help ensure your mobile application architecture is of the highest quality. It is important to put together the right technical requirements for the development team so that the experts have a joint goal and working methods.</span></p>
<h2><b>Mobile Application Architecture — Best Practices </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the process of creating a high-quality mobile application architecture, it is necessary to keep the synchronization of all the processes and capabilities of the application. What features really will be in demand in the future application is still a big question. Therefore, to include all ideas in the first version is not the best solution. This will increase the development time, overload the interface and postpone the “combat” product launch. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here we can see the standard model of the data system in the classical mobile enterprise application architecture:</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16553" src="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/mobile-enterprise-application-architecture.jpg" alt="mobile enterprise application architecture" width="722" height="571" srcset="https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/mobile-enterprise-application-architecture.jpg 722w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/mobile-enterprise-application-architecture-300x237.jpg 300w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/mobile-enterprise-application-architecture-600x475.jpg 600w, https://www.devmindgroup.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/mobile-enterprise-application-architecture-450x356.jpg 450w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px" /></p>
<h2><b>Architecture For Mobile Application &amp; Tips For Making It</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A well-designed architecture is needed for all applications, both complex and simple. Using an architecture for mobile application saves time, effort, and costs. A program with a reliable architecture is easier to tweak, test, and debug. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to understand if your application has a good architecture? Here is the checklist:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Efficiency: the application performs the tasks and performs the functions in any conditions. The system is effective, reliable, and copes with all the loads.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flexibility: the chosen solution is easy to change, and errors are few. You can change one element, and it will not be fatal influence the other one in a negative way.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extensibility: you can add as many functions as you like to the application.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scalability: time for development and updates decreases. Solid architecture allows you to direct development in several parallel threads.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Testability: The architecture for mobile application is easily tested, which means that the number of errors decreases and its reliability increases;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Understandability: the code should be understandable to as many developers as possible. A lot of people are working on the application. Good architecture allows beginners to quickly understand the project.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Final Tips For Your Mobile Architecture</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The creation of a mobile architecture is a sequential plan that must be completed before the development process begins. This plan provides a map of how the various components of the application should be organized and connected to each other. It presents guidelines that should be followed during the development process and some sacrifices (usually associated with a large number of classes and templates) that will ultimately help you create a well-written application that will be easier to test, expand, and maintain.</span></p>
